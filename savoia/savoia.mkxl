    \starttitle[title={Prelude}]
      It was 3 \fsp{a.m.}, but I was too agitated to fall asleep. In six hours I
      would be sitting in the final board meeting for the company I had
      cofounded. After five years of hard work and several attempts to make
      our business work, we had no options but to accept a fire-sale
      offer---pennies on the dollar---for our award-winning technology and
      assets. Dozens of people I had hired, people who had put their trust in
      me and my vision, would be out of a job. The three world-class venture
      capitalists who had entrusted us with not only a \textdollar{}25 million investment
      but also their time, connections, and advice would be staring angrily at
      me, my cofounder, and our executive team. I had been bitten by the Beast
      of Failure, and it hurt like hell.

      What hurt the most was that I could not figure out where I had gone
      wrong. Failure was something that only affected other people: less
      experienced, less competent, and less well-prepared people. Until then I
      had a perfect record with startups and entrepreneurship. I was an early
      employee and had a great career at two fledgling companies that
      eventually became industry giants (Sun Microsystems and Google). I had
      also cofounded a venture
      capital--backed
      company that managed to turn a \textdollar{}3 million investment into a \textdollar{}100
      million acquisition in eighteen months. My record was a perfect 3 and 0,
      and I was sure that win number 4 was just a matter of time. The formula
      was easy: identify an idea for a new product or service that solves a
      big problem, assemble a strong team, get venture funding, build the
      idea, launch it, and then go public or---worst case---get acquired for a
      pile of money.

      And we had done all that. We had an ambitious idea for a product that
      addressed a major software engineering problem in a very innovative way.
      All our due diligence and market research confirmed that companies
      needed, wanted, and would buy our product for their developers. We had
      assembled a team of amazing people who worked incredibly hard for five
      years. We had a great business plan and plenty of funding from the best
      venture capitalists (VCs) in the world to execute it---and we executed
      it, just as planned.

      So, WTF? Why The Failure? Where did we go wrong?

      Unable to sleep, I got out of bed and stared out the window thinking of
      all the other people who were, had been, or would soon be in a similar
      predicament. It was a sobering thought.

      \sectionbreak

      At this very moment, millions of people around the world are working
      hard to bring to life new ideas that, when launched, will be successful.
      Some of these ideas will turn out to be stunning successes that will
      have a major impact on our world and our culture: the next Google, the
      next polio vaccine, the next Harry Potter series, the next Red Cross,
      the next Ford Mustang. Others will be smaller, more personal, but no
      less meaningful successes: a little restaurant that becomes a
      neighborhood favorite, a biography that does not make the bestseller
      list but tells an
      important story, a local nonprofit that cares for abandoned pets.

      At this very same moment, many other people are working equally hard to
      develop new ideas that, when launched, will fail. Some of them will fail
      spectacularly and publicly: like New Coke, the movie {\em John Carter},
      or the Ford Edsel. Others will be smaller, more private, but no less
      painful failures: a home-based business that never takes off, a
      children's book that neither publishers nor children have any interest
      in, a charity for a cause that too few people care enough about.

      If you are currently working to develop a new idea, whether on your own
      or as part of a team, which group are you in? Or if at this moment you
      are still only {\em thinking} about investing to develop a new idea,
      which group will you be in?

      Most people believe that they either are or will be in the first
      group---the group whose ideas will be successful. All they have to do is
      work hard and execute well. Unfortunately, we know that this cannot be
      the case. Most new products, services, businesses, and initiatives will
      fail soon after they are launched---regardless of how promising they
      sound, how much their developers commit to them, or how well they
      execute them.

      This is a hard fact to accept. We believe that other people fail,
      because they don't know what they are doing. They are losers who have no
      business being in that business. Somehow, we believe that this does not
      apply to us and to our idea---especially if we've experienced victories
      in the past: \quotation{I am a winner. I was successful before. I will be
      successful again---just watch me!}

      That is how I used to think. And I believed I had good reasons for my
      smugness, because I had experienced a string of successes with only a
      few relatively minor setbacks. Failure was something that only affected
      other people.

      And then, just as I
      had reached new heights of confidence and hubris, the Beast of Failure
      wrapped its tentacles around me and bit me in the ass. A good,
      hard-to-ignore, and impossible-to-forget bite on that smart, competent,
      and well-prepared ass of mine.

      I could lick my wounds or bite back. I decided to bite back.

      Failure became my nemesis. Defeating it, my obsession. Teaching others
      how to defeat it, my mission.

      This book is part of that mission.

    \starttitle[title={Book Overview}]
      I am a practical guy, and this is a practical book. I believe that the
      best way to accomplish goals, deal with challenges, and solve problems
      is to approach them with the proper combination of facts, tools, and
      tactics. And that's exactly how this book is organized.

      \subject{Part I: Hard Facts}

      The initial set of chapters is my version of \quotation{the birds and the bees}
      talk you may have had to endure when you were a child. But instead of
      explaining how babies are born (and other facts of life), I will explain
      how new product ideas are hatched---and what fate awaits them---using my
      own set of metaphors.

      To begin with, we take an unflinching look at the Law of Market Failure
      in \in{Chapter}[chapter:1]. It won't be a pretty
      sight. The gauntlet that awaits most new ideas might remind you of one
      of those hard-to-watch scenes in nature documentaries, like the one
      where they show hundreds of newly hatched sea turtles
      race from the
      beach to the surf, while all sorts of predators pick them off, one by
      one, like mini-quiches at a buffet. Only a few lucky baby turtles make
      it to the water, and even fewer reach maturity. Mother Nature is
      brutal---and so is the market. Before we can consistently beat failure,
      we need to study it and understand it.

      In \in{Chapter}[chapter:2], you will learn that
      our only chance to beat the Law of Market Failure is to have an idea
      that is The Right It. I introduce The Right It and its evil twin, The
      Wrong It (an idea destined to fail in the market), and explain how and
      why we so often end up investing in ideas that are The Wrong It. You
      will also learn why I have a low opinion of opinions.

      Data! How do I love thee, let me count the ways. \in{Chapter}[chapter:3]
      is dedicated to my passion for
      data---especially market data. But you will also learn that I don't love
      all data equally. In fact, I am very, very picky about my data. The goal
      of this chapter is to make you love (or at least appreciate) data as
      much as I do and to be as choosy with it as I am.

      \subject{Part II: Sharp Tools}

      You've probably heard the expressions \quotation{You need the right tool for the
      job} and \quotation{You are only as good as your tools.} Well, we have one heck of
      a job to do, and we have no chance of succeeding without the right
      tools. Part II: Sharp Tools is our toolbox. In it, I introduce you to a
      set of powerful tools that will give you a significant advantage in
      fighting failure.

      The root cause of most failures can be traced back to muddy, fuzzy,
      undisciplined thinking. Unless and until we can articulate our new
      product idea clearly and thoroughly, our odds of
      market success
      will not improve. In \in{Chapter}[chapter:4] you
      will learn a surprisingly simple but incredibly effective set of tools
      designed to turn your thinking from fuzzy to razor sharp.

      In \in{Chapter}[chapter:5], I introduce the
      concept of {\em pretotyping}, point out how pr{\em e}totyping differs
      from pr{\em o}totyping, and explain why that single vowel makes all the
      difference in our quest for The Right It. Then I share with you a
      powerful collection of pretotyping techniques along with many examples
      of how to use pretotypes to test how the market responds to your new
      product idea.

      Pretotyping experiments give you a lot of great fresh firsthand market
      data. But having great data is not enough. In order to make the right
      decisions, the data has to be analyzed and interpreted rigorously and
      objectively. In \in{Chapter}[chapter:6], you
      will get the tools to do just that.

      \subject{Part III: Plastic Tactics}

      In the final part of the book, I share with you my thoughts on the best
      ways to put your newfound knowledge and tools into action. \in{Chapter}[chapter:7]
      is where you will learn four powerful
      tactics to help you organize and execute your market validation tests in
      the most efficient way possible. In \in{Chapter}[chapter:8],
      I'll walk you through a realistic
      scenario of what happens to an idea for a new business when we apply the
      tools and tactics that we've learned.

      The first eight chapters of the book are fact-oriented and
      practical---mostly nuts-and-bolts and how-to stuff. In the final
      chapter, \in{Chapter}[chapter:9], I raise the
      level of our discourse and get a bit more abstract and philosophical.
      The tools and tactics you've learned will give you new power and a
      significant advantage against the Beast of Failure. What will you use
      that newfound
      power and
      advantage for? What kind of new products, services, or businesses would
      you tackle if you knew that the odds for success were greatly in your
      favor? I will encourage you to think bigger and aim higher.

      \subject{Tall Tales and Short Stories}

      I've included many real-world stories in this book. I chose each story
      based on how well it illustrates a point, technique, or moral. But as
      you read them, keep in mind that they are just that, {\em stories}. And,
      as with all stories, different people see things differently, remember
      things differently, and draw different conclusions. On top of that, many
      of these stories have enough complexity and interesting lessons that
      each could be the worthy subject for an entire book, but here I may
      summarize them in a paragraph or two.

      For example, you will read about Webvan, a company that failed
      spectacularly after investing nearly \textdollar{}1 billion based on a vision for a
      grocery home-delivery company. It's a huge story with lots of
      interesting subplots and lessons and a cast of thousands from venture
      capitalists, to the CEO, to hundreds of employees in all sorts of
      functions (managers, warehouse workers, accountants, truck drivers,
      \fsp{etc.}). Each of them was involved with, was affected by, and saw the
      company's failure in different and often contradictory ways. The Webvan
      investors' story is going to be different from the CEO's story, which is
      going to be different from that of one of the company's truck drivers or
      accountants.

      In Akira Kurosawa's classic movie {\em Rashomon}, four witnesses
      describe the same murder in four mutually contradictory ways.
      When a new product
      or company fails, there are as many stories as there are witnesses. The
      Rashomon Effect is in full swing. Even my own stories and examples---the
      ones I witnessed firsthand and participated in---are bound to be
      distorted by my unique perspective, my own biases, and my imperfect
      memory.

      Aiming for 100\textpercent{} accuracy and thoroughness is an
      impossible task, given the myriad of complex and hard-to-quantify
      factors that can cause a new product or company to succeed or fail. But
      we can still extract valuable lessons and rules of thumb that might work
      for us.

      Bottom line: I have selected and summarized examples with the goal of
      maximum usefulness, impact, and memorability. I took a lot of \quotation{to the
      best of my recollection} stories and case studies and translated them
      into a form optimized for {\em your} recollection and benefit. Besides,
      even if I were somehow able to give a perfect account of each example, I
      would still warn you to consider it nothing more than anecdotal evidence
      from other people, at other times, and in different circumstances---what
      later in the book I introduce as OPD, Other People's Data.

      So take each story you read with several grains of salt.

      \subject{Terminology}

      The tools and tactics described in this book apply to all sorts of
      ideas: ideas for new products (or for new features to be added to
      existing products); ideas for new services (or for new offerings to be
      added to existing services); and ideas for new businesses or
      organizations of all types (for profit, not for profit, commercial,
      political, philosophical). However, since I don't care to continually
      write, and I'm sure you don't care to endlessly read, \quotation{idea
      for a new product,
      service, business, or organization,} most of the time I will simply use
      the word {\em product} (or {\em It}, capitalized, as in The Right It).
      In the context of this book, the terms {\em product} and {\em It} can
      refer to a new musical instrument, a mobile app, an innovative
      diaper-delivery service, a social-media startup (as if we need another
      one of those), a video game, a genetically engineered hypoallergenic
      hamster, a new college course or academic discipline (Failure Science?),
      a charitable organization, a new religion or cult (no, please!), and so
      on.

      Similarly, the term {\em market} as used in the book doesn't necessarily
      mean people with wallets, but any group you think will want, use, adopt,
      or somehow engage with your idea. If you are planning to design and
      launch a new high-school class, your market is the students. If you are
      thinking of enacting a new law to regulate, say, speeding bicyclists in
      your town, your market is pedaling citizens.

      In other words, the tools and tactics covered in the book apply to any
      undertaking in any market that involves:
      \startenumerate
        \startitem
          a nontrivial investment,
        \stopitem
        \startitem
          a high probability of failure, and
        \stopitem
        \startitem
          the desire to avoid that failure.
        \stopitem
      \stopenumerate
      And that accounts for pretty much all major human endeavors.

      \subject{Credit Where Credit Is Due}

      I want to be up front about the fact that my role, and the purpose of
      this book, is not to present previously unknown facts and completely
      original ideas. Some of the tools and techniques I share with you have
      been around for centuries---but they never
      got the visibility
      and attention they deserved, nor were they ever given a name. I dug them
      out, dusted them off, polished them a bit, and put them on display.
      Think of me as a collector, curator, and guide to these ideas.

      Many of the inspirations, examples, and scenarios are source materials
      I've collected over the past few years as I dedicated myself to
      developing, practicing, and teaching these tools and techniques to
      anyone who'd listen. Thanks to Google and Stanford University, I have
      had the opportunity to give hundreds of talks, seminars, and workshops
      and to participate in countless hands-on coaching sessions in which I've
      applied these techniques to real-world projects side by side with
      students, entrepreneurs, and even Fortune 500 CEOs. These people and
      organizations not only put these ideas into practice, but suggested new
      tools and many improvements. They also provided me with relevant stories
      and accounts from many different industries. So whatever product,
      service, or business you are planning to pursue, you will find help
      here.

      \subject{I Practice What I Teach}

      Do I practice what I teach? You bet! I practice it not because it would
      look bad if I didn't, but because what I teach works and has been
      working amazingly well for me and for my students and clients. In fact,
      the tools and techniques you'll learn in this book {\em cannot not work}
      because, as you will discover, they are grounded in proven facts and
      based on simple logic. Master them, put them to use, and you will flip
      the odds for market success in your favor and win most battles with the
      Beast of Failure.

      This book is a good example of my practicing what I teach.
      Let me explain.
      Writing a book is a major undertaking, and I was well aware that most
      authors never find a publisher or a significant audience for their work.
      In other words, most books fail in the market.

      So, before deciding to invest a year or more in writing a proper book
      and taking the risk that nobody would read it or find it useful, I did
      an experiment. I gave myself five days to write a short booklet, which I
      titled: {\em Pretotype It: Make Sure You Are Building The Right It
      Before You Build It Right}.\footnote{If you want to check
      out the original booklet, just search online for \quotation{Pretotype It Alberto
      Savoia.}}
      The booklet introduced the concept of The Right It along with a rough
      version of some of the tools and techniques you will read about in this
      book. I printed and manually stapled a few dozen copies of the booklet
      and handed them out to colleagues and friends.

      A couple of days later, I began to receive requests for more copies.
      \quotation{Hey, Alberto, loved the book. Can you get me ten more copies? I'd like
      to share this with my team. I am happy to pay you for them.}

      Soon the requests for additional copies outpaced my ability to produce
      them by hand. So I ordered a big batch from a printing shop, and then
      another batch, and another. Eventually, tired of trips to the printer
      and schlepping heavy boxes around, I decided to put a PDF of the booklet
      online and to make it available for free, so people could print it
      themselves if they wanted. By request, I also created a Kindle version
      and put it on sale on Amazon for 99\textcent{} (the lowest price allowed).

      A few days later, I began to receive emails from people I did not know
      telling me how much they liked the booklet and thanking me for writing
      it. A lot of them encouraged me to write
      a proper book with
      more techniques and examples. I also started to receive invitations to
      give talks and workshops on The Right It and pretotyping at major
      companies and universities. Several people from different parts of the
      world volunteered to translate the booklet into their language; and I
      gave them all my permission with the condition that a PDF of their
      translation must also be available for free. Thanks to their efforts,
      today there are about a dozen translations of {\em Pretotype It}
      available.

      The first version of that booklet came out in 2011. Since then, the
      original PDF and eBook versions (and their translations) have been
      copied and posted on countless websites, so I have no way of knowing how
      many people have actually downloaded and read it, but I believe it's in
      the tens of thousands. And all of this with practically no marketing or
      advertising, simply by word of mouth.

      In life and business, including the book business, there are no
      guarantees. But the strong initial and ongoing interest in my
      experimental booklet and the many success stories from the people who
      applied the lessons and techniques in it were enough to convince me to
      invest the time and effort required to write a proper book---the book
      you are currently reading.

    \startpart[title={Hard Facts},reference=part:1]
      \startchapter[title={The Law of Market Failure},reference=chapter:1]
        I like hard facts. The harder, the better. I like them even when they go
        against my desires and preferences. I like them because they are
        grounded in reality, and that grounding gives me a solid foundation---a
        bedrock I can build upon. Facing and accepting hard facts may feel
        uncomfortable at first, but that initial distress is nothing compared to
        the problems and pain that await those who choose to ignore them.

        The hard facts we will explore share three dimensions of hardness:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            They are {\em hard} to take. They may be difficult to accept, at least
            at first.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            They are based on {\em hard}, objective data, not on tenuous hopes,
            wobbly beliefs, or volatile opinions.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            They are {\em hard} in the sense of being solid, unyielding, and
            permanent. They are unlikely to change---at least in your lifetime.
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        The last two
        characteristics of hard facts, objectivity and permanence, make them
        universal and timeless, so you better get used to them.

        My goal for the first part of the book is to expose you to key hard
        facts about failure and success. If I do my job well, and if you keep an
        open mind and a courageous attitude, you will find yourself not only
        accepting and respecting hard facts, as I do, but also depending on
        them, valuing them, and seeking them out, as I do. A hard fact is good
        to find.

        \section{Failure Is Not an Option---Not!}

        \quotation{Failure is not an option!} I am sure you've heard that phrase before in
        action movies, motivational speeches, and desperate staff meetings. It's
        a great quote. So optimistic. So inspiring. So confident. And yet so
        wrong.

        When it comes to bringing new product ideas to market, failure is always
        an option. In fact, it is---by far---the most likely outcome anytime
        anyone tries to do something new or different. This is true in art, in
        science, in relationships---everywhere. And it's most definitely true in
        the world of business. Most new businesses fail, and most new products
        launched by existing businesses fail.

        Telling yourself that failure is not an option may work if you are a
        hero in a Hollywood action movie or if you are stuck in a jam with only
        one way out. But if you are planning to launch a new product into the
        market, to say, believe, or act according to \quotation{failure is not an option}
        is to go against reality---always a bad idea. Those five words may give
        you an initial boost of confidence or motivation, but that boost will be
        short-lived and, more often than not, you will be boosted in the wrong
        direction---straight into the jaws of the Beast of Failure.

        I offer you a more
        realistic formulation:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Failure is the most likely outcome.}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Consider this your first hard fact, and remember that hard facts are
        your friends even if they may not appear so at first glance. As you go
        through this book, you will see why treating failure as the most likely
        outcome for any new idea is a much more effective way to think, because
        it aligns with the reality of the market, and that alignment will
        ultimately and consistently lead you to more successes in the market.

        This first hard fact about failure is so important and so deserving of
        respect that I believe it's wise to treat it as a {\em law}.

        \section{The Law of Market Failure}

        I've already characterized failure as a beast, and I will use the
        metaphor of the Beast of Failure throughout the book because,
        psychologically, that image conjures up the kind of fears and emotions
        most people feel when faced with failure. We must not ignore those
        psychological effects, because they do impact how we think and act. But
        I also want to present and deal with failure in a more objective and
        analytical way. When new products are brought to market, failure is the
        rule, not the exception. Failure is so consistent, persistent, and
        ubiquitous that it will serve us well to treat it as a law and give it
        the respect it
        deserves.\footnote{I am aware that,
        technically, calling this a law is a stretch. It's clearly not in the
        same category as, say, Newton's First Law of Motion. So why do I call it
        a law? Because I want you to pay attention to it, respect it, take it
        into account. I could have called it \quotation{a rule of thumb} or \quotation{an
        observation,} but those and other such terms lack the necessary
        gravitas.} The Law of
        Market Failure is this:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Most new products will fail in the market,\crlf{} even if competently executed.}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        I wrote the law on two lines because it packs a one-two punch:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Punch 1: Most new products will fail in the market.}

          {\em Ouch!}

          {\bf Punch 2: They will fail even if competently executed.}

          {\em Double ouch!}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        I will soon give you hard evidence to back up the hard fact that failure
        is the most likely outcome for any new product. But before we go there,
        it's a good idea to clarify what we mean by market failure---and the
        more elusive market success.

        \section{Market Failure and Success Defined}

        For our purposes, {\em market failure} means any actual market result
        from an investment in a new product that is {\em less than or the
        opposite of the expected result}.

        Let me explain. When you bring a new product to market, you make an
        investment---an investment of money, time, resources, and reputation.
        You make that investment with the expectation that you'll achieve
        specific desirable results: more revenue, bigger profits, a larger
        market share, new customers, more publicity, and so on. For example:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Two employees quit their secure jobs and invest their savings to start
            their own company, {\em expecting} that they will be happier and/or
            make more money being their own bosses.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A company invests in developing a new and improved
            version of an
            existing product, {\em expecting} that it will sell more and be more
            profitable than the previous one.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            An expert in a field takes an unpaid sabbatical to write a book in
            which he shares his expertise, {\em expecting} that the book will be
            published and that it will add to his reputation. A publisher decides
            to publish that same book {\em expecting} that it will sell well.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A restaurateur operating a popular and profitable restaurant opens a
            second location, {\em expecting} that it will also be popular and
            profitable.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A highway department invests in adding new toll-road lanes to a busy
            freeway, {\em expecting} that this will ease traffic congestion and
            generate enough revenue to pay for itself.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        If you launch your product into the market and the actual results are
        less than or the opposite of what you expected, that's what we call a
        market failure.

        Our definition of market success is the flip side of the one for market
        failure. {\em Market success} means any actual market result from an
        investment in a new product that {\em matches or surpasses the expected
        result}.

        It's important to note that some products can be a market failure but
        still be considered successful based on other criteria. A movie that
        garners critical praise but flops at the box office is still a market
        failure---at least for those who invested in it hoping to make a profit.
        A new product that does exactly what it's supposed to do, does it better
        than anything else, but does not sell enough to enable a profitable
        business may be a marvel of engineering, but it's still a market
        failure. A new toll road that eases traffic congestion but does not
        generate enough revenue might
        be considered a
        success by commuters, but it's a market failure as far as the taxpayers
        are concerned. It's important to be explicit about your success criteria
        before you get started.

        Now that we have clear and specific definitions of what we mean by
        market failure and market success, let's explore in more detail how
        often, how, and why most new products do fail.

        \section{Market Failure Statistics}

        The first line in the Law of Market Failure states: \quotation{Most new products
        will fail in the market.} By using the word {\em most}, I am implying
        that more than 50\textpercent{} of all new products fail. That's a
        safe position to take. I have yet to find an industry in which the
        majority of new products consistently succeed. This makes perfect sense,
        because that would indicate an industry or market with infinite demand
        and resources to absorb a huge number of new products---and there's no
        such thing.

        But what is the actual rate of failure? Is it 51\textpercent{},
        70\textpercent{}, 95\textpercent{}, 99\textpercent{}? The answer
        depends on a number of factors, among them the type of business or
        industry, how many companies and products are included in the study, and
        the definition of failure.

        In the broader consumer-products market, some of the best data on
        new-product failure comes from the venerable firm Nielsen Research. For
        decades, Nielsen has been tracking tens of thousands of new product
        launches. Every year it produces a report on how those products have
        fared in the market. The results are remarkably consistent:
        approximately 80\textpercent{} of new products fall short of their
        original expectations and are categorized as \quotation{failed,} \quotation{disappointing,}
        or \quotation{canceled}---year after year, with no exceptions.

        If you research or
        talk to people like authors or publishers, mobile app developers,
        venture capitalists, and restaurateurs, you will hear the same story and
        get roughly the same 80\textpercent{} number over and over. So if you
        are looking for a number to replace \quotation{most} in the Law of Market Failure,
        anything in the range of 70\textpercent{} to 90\textpercent{} will
        do. I suggest you err on the side of caution and begin by assuming a
        90\textpercent{} chance of failure for any new product idea.

        The statistics on new-product failure are clear, consistent, and
        convincing. But what's behind those numbers? Why do most new products
        fail? Hard facts are easier to accept and deal with if we understand
        their causes. So let me begin to answer those questions by exposing the
        logic that explains why failure is a much more likely outcome than
        success.

        \section{The Success Equation}

        Success depends on a number of key factors. A {\em factor} is a
        circumstance, fact, or event that contributes to a result or outcome.
        And a {\em key factor} is one that {\em must} be done right or turn out
        right for the idea to succeed. Most results and outcomes depend on the
        interaction of multiple key factors, and to have a successful outcome
        all key factors must be done right or turn out right.

        To help visualize and analyze this concept we can use a formula that I
        call the Success Equation:
        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Right A \textmultiply{} Right B \textmultiply{} Right C \textmultiply{} Right D \textmultiply{} Right E, \fsp{etc.} = Success}
        \stopmiddlealignment
        \noindentation
        where A, B, C, D, E, \fsp{etc.}, are key factors for success.

        A competent and well-trained kitchen staff is a key success factor for a
        new restaurant; let's call it key success factor A. But
        success also requires
        finding a suitable space in the right neighborhood (B), good suppliers
        (C), capable servers (D), sound financial management (E), good marketing
        and a sufficient marketing budget (F), and competent operations (G). In
        addition, you need the cooperation of factors that are mostly outside
        your control, like the overall economic climate, competitors, and
        reviewers. All of these are key factors. All of these must turn out
        right for the restaurant to succeed---and that's a lot of {\em rights}
        in a row.

        On the other hand, all it takes for something to fail is for a single
        key factor to go wrong---just one!

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Right A \textmultiply{} Right B \textmultiply{} Right C \textmultiply{} \underbar{\em Wrong D} \textmultiply{} Right E,
          \fsp{etc.} = Failure}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Right A \textmultiply{} \underbar{\em Wrong B} \textmultiply{} Right C \textmultiply{} Right D \textmultiply{} Right E,
          \fsp{etc.} = Failure}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Remember when you first learned in math class that any number, no matter
        how large and impressive, when multiplied by zero results in zero? The
        same general idea applies to the Success Equation.

        A single bad review from an influential critic in a bad mood can doom a
        restaurant---whether you've spent \textdollar{}1,000 or \textdollar{}1 million in marketing.
        Any number of success factors done right or gone right can be undone by
        a single thing done wrong or gone wrong. (For those of you who are
        mathematically inclined, if a successful outcome depends on {\em n} key
        factors being right, there are 2\high{\em n} \char"2212{} 1 ways to fail---and only 1
        way to succeed.) With the odds so heavily stacked against them, it's not
        surprising that most new products fail. The real mystery---or
        surprise---is that some products beat those odds and succeed.

        This brutal logic explains the statistics behind the Law of Market
        Failure---but it's also the logic we'll use to beat it.

        \section{Too Smart to Fail?}

        Most people don't argue too much with the first part of the Law of
        Market Failure. After I provide them with the statistical evidence and
        the logic behind it, they eventually accept the hard fact that most new
        products will fail in the market. But I get a lot more resistance to the
        second part of the law, the part that states that most new products will
        fail \quotation{even if competently executed.}

        Very few people are ready to accept that, and I understand their
        reluctance. That's exactly what I used to think, that failure is the
        result of incompetence or inexperience at one or more points during the
        execution of a new product. Unfortunately, competence in execution is
        not an antidote to failure. That's a hard pill to swallow, but swallow
        it you must. If you operate under the delusion that experience and
        competence in a given field or market insulate you from the Law of
        Market Failure, not only will you still fail, but your hubris will be
        punished by your failing in an even bigger and more painful way.

        In my workshops and classes, I prove my point by showing case after case
        of dramatic failures by people and companies widely considered the best
        in their respective markets. Here are some examples.

        Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are arguably the two most successful companies in
        the soft-drink industry. Both companies are world-class experts at
        making, marketing, and distributing anything bottled and bubbly; they
        have decades of experience and unparalleled know-how and resources. None
        of that impresses the Law of Market Failure. Coca-Cola's New Coke---a
        mid-1980s reformulation of one of the most iconic products in
        history---involved a massive market-research and publicity
        effort. But, despite
        all that work, research, and preparation, New Coke was met with a
        response that ranged from negative to downright hostile. The company had
        to rush back to offering the original formulation. PepsiCo experienced a
        similar failure with Crystal Pepsi, a coloring-free, caffeine-free
        alternative to regular Pepsi.

        Did you see the movie {\em John Carter}? If you answered no, you are in
        good company. The movie was a flop---even though it was a Disney movie
        with a \textdollar{}250 million production budget and a \textdollar{}100 million marketing
        budget. Disney is no Dumbo when it comes to making and marketing movies;
        on the contrary, it's one of the most savvy, experienced, and successful
        movie studios in history. But its competence does not make it immune to
        the Law of Market Failure. The same applies to filmmaker George Lucas,
        who followed the hugely successful {\em Star Wars} with {\em Howard the
        Duck}---a disastrous flop.

        Google is one of the most experienced and competent companies in the
        world when it comes to developing and launching internet products. And
        yet, in 2010, the same company that brought you Google Search, Google
        Maps, and Gmail, launched Google Wave---a new way for teams to
        collaborate online. Despite an impressive amount of press, hype, and
        enthusiasm, Google Wave ran smack into the Law of Market Failure, and
        the company began to phase it out in a matter of months. The same fate
        awaited many other high-profile and well-publicized Google products such
        as Google Buzz and Google Glass. Dozens of lesser known Google products
        also failed or fizzled out---ever heard of or used Jaiku or Google
        Answers?

        In my classes I like to ask students to name all the Google and
        Microsoft products
        they use or know about. Then I show them a list of Google and Microsoft
        products that failed. My list is always at least five times longer than
        theirs. If you search online for \quotation{Google failures} or \quotation{Microsoft
        failures,} you will find several compilations of the companies' many
        unsuccessful products---including a Pinterest page called the Google
        Graveyard and one called the Microsoft Morgue.

        Of course, most companies don't advertise their failures---they bury
        their dead quietly and move on. But if you dig a little, you will find
        that you can pick any successful company and create the equivalent of
        the Google Graveyard or Microsoft Morgue for it. For example, the
        McDonald's Mortuary might include the ill-fated McLobster, the Hula
        Burger (with a slice of pineapple instead of meat), and
        McSpaghetti---which, as an Italian, I find particularly disturbing.

        Competent companies that are more aggressive and more innovative will
        easily have a ratio of failed to successful products of 5 to 1, if not
        more. But even more conservative and competent companies will fail far
        more often than not. The most striking thing about these failed products
        is that the people, resources, and companies behind them are not only
        competent, but often the best in their field---with decades of
        experience. The Law of Market Failure is blind.

        The hard fact to take away is that, although experience and competence
        are necessary to achieve lasting success with a product that the market
        wants, they are powerless when applied to a product that the market is
        not interested in. In fact, experience and competence often result in an
        even bigger and more public failure, because we tend to make a bigger
        investment and set unrealistically high expectations.

        \section{Failophobia}

        To summarize, most new products will fail, failure can happen in many
        ways, and competent execution is not enough to defeat the Law of Market
        Failure. But what is the primary reason for all these failures? Can we
        identify a major culprit---enemy number one---so that we can maneuver to
        avoid it?

        I had such a culprit in mind, but I did not want to draw general
        conclusions based only on my experience. So after my first major
        experience with failure I decided to return to Google, get my old job
        back, and, while working on new projects, learn more about failure.
        Fortunately, Google not only took me back, but welcomed me with open
        arms and gave me a great opportunity to study failure. The company had
        become very interested in how failure affected its ability to innovate
        and launch new products and asked me and a few others to investigate the
        problem and propose some solutions. I could not have asked for a better
        setup.

        As a company, Google has a relatively high tolerance for failure. But
        although the Beast of Failure did not intimidate the company as a whole,
        it scared the heck out of most individual employees. Google, the
        company, understood and accepted that failure is an inevitable
        by-product of innovation. But most Google employees preferred to work on
        already successful and well-known products; they did not want to risk
        failure by joining a group working on a new and unproven idea. They
        wanted to tell their friends and family, \quotation{You know Gmail? I work on
        that!} as opposed to, \quotation{I am an engineer on project SnarfBlatt.}

        This deeply human desire for being associated with success and avoiding
        failure---{\em failophobia}---is why many already successful companies
        have trouble staying innovative even when they, as organizations, are
        prepared to accept some failures. At
        the company level,
        one really successful new product, like Gmail, can easily erase dozens
        of failures, like Google Wave, but any individual employee will have two
        or three years of work on a failed product on his or her own résumé.
        While working at Google as engineering director, I witnessed this
        behavior every time I tried to recruit engineers or product managers for
        key roles in new and exciting but risky projects. Because of
        failophobia, most candidates chose to accept lesser roles working on
        already established successes.

        But although many Google employees wanted to avoid new failures, they
        had no problem talking about their {\em past} failures. In fact, they
        loved to talk about them. Many of these discussions reminded me of the
        scene from the movie {\em Jaws} where the characters played by Robert
        Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss share their shark-attack stories, taking pride
        in their battle scars and trying to one-up each other: \quotation{If you think
        your failure was bad, wait until you hear my story!}

        It was fascinating to hear these smart and competent people recount
        their failures. But I cared mostly about the answer to one question:
        {\em Why} do you think your product failed?

        \section{FLOP}

        After interviewing scores of people about their experiences with
        failure, a clear pattern emerged. Most projects failed for three
        reasons:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf F}ailure due to {\bf L}aunch, {\bf O}perations, or {\bf P}remise
        \stopnarrow

        Which gives us the appropriate (and easy to remember) acronym FLOP.

        \startconcept{Failure due to Launch}
          happens when the sales, marketing, or distribution efforts
          accompanying your new product fail to reach the intended market with the
          necessary visibility or availability. In other words, too many of the
          people who are supposed to need or want your product or service (\fsp{i.e.},
          your intended target market) don't know it exists, don't know enough
          about it, or can't get their hands on it. It may be the greatest idea
          ever, beautifully executed, and a perfect solution to a major problem,
          but if you can't get the word or your product out to your target market,
          it will fail.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Failure due to Operations}
          occurs when your new product's design,
          functionality, or reliability fails to meet a minimum threshold of user
          expectations. For example, a beautiful-looking but uncomfortable chair,
          a restaurant with great food but lousy service, or a mobile app that
          constantly crashes. You may be able to get a few early adopters to buy
          or use your product or service, but inevitably, if your implementation
          of the idea is not good enough, word will get out and it will fail.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Failure due to Premise}
          happens when people are simply not
          interested in your idea. They know about it, they understand it, and
          they believe that it does what it promises reliably and efficiently.
          They can also easily find it, try it, or buy it, but they just don't
          care.
        \stopconcept

        Through my interviews, I identified these as the three main reasons most
        products fail in the market, but something about these answers bugged
        me. People's accounts of the failures involved an initial pattern of
        blaming, which muddied the results. When a project fails, people point
        fingers. In a high-tech project,
        for example,
        engineering blames marketing, marketing blames engineering, everyone
        blames sales, and sales blames everyone. Similarly, if a restaurant
        fails, people point the finger at the chef, or the service staff, or the
        marketing team, or even the decorator. But when I pressed my
        interviewees to get past the blame game, when I asked them to seek a
        more fundamental root cause for the failure of their project, they
        realized that most of the people involved were competent---often even
        exceptional---in their respective designing, building, marketing, and
        selling responsibilities. There may have been some launch and operation
        issues, but those were not the root cause for the failure.

        Once they got past the finger-pointing, most people had a similar
        epiphany: \quotation{I guess that, after all is said and done, we did a pretty
        darn good job building and marketing our product, but it was a product
        that not enough people really wanted or needed. I'll be damned!} After
        the fog of blame lifted, one root cause emerged above all others:
        Premise. A small percentage of products fail in the market because they
        are poorly launched or built; the majority fail because they are the
        wrong product idea to start with. I had found my enemy number one, the
        most common reason behind the market failure of new products.

        This result came as a surprise to most people---including me. I had
        always spent most of my time and energy on a new product making sure
        that we were building it right (robust, high-quality, scalable, with
        lots of features) and then on marketing and selling it right. But
        because we had assumed from the start that we were building the right
        product, more often than not all that time and effort and competence
        went into a product that in fact turned out to be wrong for the market.

        Most new products fail not because of incompetence in designing,
        building, or marketing, but simply because they are not
        what the market
        wants. We build {\em It} right but we don't build {\em The Right It}---a
        product that enough people want or need to justify developing it.

        I summarized that realization in the following sentence, which has
        become my mantra and the reason and motivation for this book:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Make sure you are building The Right It\crlf{} before you build It right.}
        \stopmiddlealignment
      \stopchapter

      \startchapter[title={The Right It},reference=chapter:2]
        {\em The Right It} is not just the title of this book. It's the star of
        this book. It's what it takes to beat the Law of Market Failure---in
        fact, it's the {\em only} thing that can beat it. So let me take some
        time to clarify and expand on what I mean by The Right It. I begin by
        defining it. {\em The Right It is an idea for a new product that, if
        competently executed, will succeed in the market.}

        In business, there are no good ideas or bad ideas; there are only ideas
        that succeed in the market and ideas that fail in the market. As we have
        seen, most ideas will fail---even if competently executed. The minority
        of ideas that become a market success have one thing in common: they are
        {\em The Right It}. In other words, take an idea that is The Right It,
        add competent execution, and the idea will succeed in the market.

        Does that mean that if {\em you} combine an idea that is The Right It
        with {\em your} competent execution, {\em you} are guaranteed success?
        Sorry, it doesn't work that way. First of all, there are no
        guarantees in
        business. Second, the definition says that the {\em idea} will succeed,
        not {\em you}. It's always possible that someone else will execute the
        same idea better or faster than you. This happens all the time. In fact,
        once the market for an idea is proven, other people will realize that
        the idea is The Right It and jump in and try to do it better---or just
        differently. Pizza is a great example of an idea that is The Right It
        (possibly my favorite example); all it takes is a ten-minute drive
        around town to see how many companies, both large and small, have jumped
        in to grab a slice---ahem---of the pizza market.

        Even though success in business cannot be guaranteed, if you are working
        with an idea that is The Right It, your odds for success will increase
        dramatically. And if you apply the tools and tactics you will learn in
        this book, you will be able to determine if an idea is likely to be The
        Right It quickly and reliably. You might still fail in the end if you
        don't execute well or competitors execute better, but when compared with
        the odds you have when dealing with The Wrong It, this is a huge
        advantage. Speaking of The Wrong It~.~.~.

        \section{The Wrong It}

        The Wrong It is the evil twin of The Right It. I define it as follows:
        {\em The Wrong It is an idea for a new product that, even if competently
        executed, will fail in the market.}

        Every time a team of experienced and competent people work hard to
        develop and launch a high-quality new product and that new product fails
        in the market, they've fallen victim to The Wrong It. The basic Premise
        for their idea (remember the P from FLOP) is out of sync with the
        reality (the actual needs
        and wants) of the
        market. No amount of competent execution (brilliant design, clever
        engineering, impeccable quality, masterful marketing, or superior
        salesmanship) can save a product that is based on the wrong Premise. In
        fact, the more time and effort you invest in The Wrong It, the longer,
        bigger, and more painful your failure will be. Going to market with an
        idea that is The Wrong It is a hopeless task. Even if you manage to
        create some initial buzz and interest for the product (perhaps with some
        marketing fireworks), your odds of {\em long-term} success are still
        0.0\textpercent{}.

        Now that we've defined and explained both The Right It and The Wrong It,
        we should answer two key questions:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            Why do so many presumably experienced people fall in the trap and
            waste their experience and competence executing The Wrong It?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How can we know if an idea is The Right It before we invest too much
            in developing it?
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        I will answer the first question in the next few pages; the second
        question is the focus of \in{Parts}[part:2] and
        \in[part:3] of this book.

        \section{Thoughtland}

        How is it possible that so many competent and successful people and
        organizations invest so much time and energy in developing products
        that, more often than not, fail in the market? Shouldn't these experts
        know better? Don't they know that they need to do some market research
        before pulling the trigger on a new product? Why do they keep falling
        into The Wrong It trap?

        Once again, I set out to answer these questions by
        interviewing dozens
        of people from different industries and asking them a series of pesky
        questions:

        \startnarrow
          {\em How do you know if the product you are currently building is
          something that the market wants?~.~.~. I see, you do market research.
          And what market research techniques do you use?~.~.~. Interesting. And
          how well have those market research techniques worked for you in the
          past?~.~.~. Ouch, that doesn't sound like a winning record---more misses
          than hits. By the way, how much did you spend on that research?~.~.~.
          Wow, that's a bunch of time and money to get such unreliable
          results.~.~.~. You agree? Then why do you keep using those techniques?}
        \stopnarrow

        What I learned from these interviews is that most successful people and
        organizations are fully aware that having the right product premise is
        critical for market success (duh!). To make sure that they have the
        right product, they invest significant time and money on market
        research. And yet most of those products still fail. What's going on?

        After digging up for autopsy a lot of product corpses that failed
        despite extensive market research, I identified a recurring---and
        problematic---pattern: most of the so-called market research for those
        products was not done in the actual market, but in a fictional
        environment I call Thoughtland. Thoughtland is an imaginary place where
        every potential new product begins life as a simple, pure, abstract
        idea. Think of it as an idea hatchery. So far, so good.

        The problem arises when an idea spends too much time in Thoughtland
        after it's hatched. When that happens, the idea starts to attract
        opinions the way a ship's hull attracts barnacles. Some people think the
        idea is great. Others think the idea is lame. Even
        so-called experts
        disagree. Opinions about an idea are not data---not even close. Opinions
        are subjective, biased judgments. They are guesses thrown out without
        much thought, evidence, and---critically---with no skin in the game (if
        you are not sure about what I mean by \quotation{skin in the game,} stay tuned, as
        I will discuss this important concept in detail later). If an idea
        spends too much time in Thoughtland, it gets wrapped in a fuzzy ball of
        unsubstantiated off-the-cuff judgments, beliefs, preferences, and
        predictions.

        You cannot determine if an idea is The Right It just through thinking.
        Not through your thoughts. Not through the thoughts and opinions of
        others. Not through the thoughts of \quotation{experts.}

        You are no Nostradamus. Nor am I. Nor is anyone else. At best, our
        predictions turn out to be right {\em some} of the time---but that's
        mostly luck.

        The Right It cannot be deduced or induced while you stay in Thoughtland.
        It has to be discovered through experimentation in the real world. And
        yet most market research is Thoughtland-based---and that's bad news. To
        better explain what I am talking about, let me illustrate why
        Thoughtland-based market research is dangerous using one of the most
        common market research tools: the focus group.

        \section{Hocus-Pocus Focus Groups}

        In case you are not familiar with marketing focus groups, let me give
        you an example that illustrates why and how they are used. I like beer,
        and it goes well with another one of my favorite examples, pizza, so I
        will use it for this example, but the process is the same for all
        products and services.

        Let's pretend that Alberto's Beer Company (ABC)---a
        successful brewing
        company run by highly experienced beverage executives---wants to capture
        a greater share of the female drinkers market. To better understand this
        gender-specific market, ABC decides to use focus groups. It begins by
        bringing groups of women drinkers into a room (often equipped with a
        one-way mirror) and asking them a series of questions, such as:

        \startnarrow
          {\em When you choose a drink, how often do you choose beer?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em When you choose a drink other than beer, what are the reasons for
          it?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em What would it take for you to choose beer more often?}
        \stopnarrow

        Then it compiles the results and comes up with a list of \quotation{insights} that
        looks something like this:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            55\textpercent{} of focus-group participants said they prefer white
            wine to beer, because they think it's a more appropriate drink for a
            lady. Sample quote: \quotation{Telling the bartender \quote{Bring me a Bud} does not
            sound very ladylike.}
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            31\textpercent{} agreed with the comment that light beer tastes \quotation{too
            light} and \quotation{flavorless} and nonlight beers are usually \quotation{too heavy} or
            \quotation{too bitter.}
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            38\textpercent{} said that they would be more likely to order beer
            if there was a brand that looked and tasted more \quotation{feminine.}
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Armed with this \quotation{data,} ABC comes up with a new product idea, LadyLike,
        a light yet flavorful beer packaged in a slim bottle. The executives
        love the idea and give the go-ahead to brew a few batches of the beer
        (perhaps with a few flavor variations), design a fancy new bottle and
        logo, and run a second focus group to see if ABC is on the right track.

        In this second focus
        group, the participants are introduced to the potential new brand, they
        get a chance to taste it, and then they are asked another series of
        questions:

        \startnarrow
          {\em If LadyLike beer were available, how likely would you be to choose
          it over white wine?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em If you could choose between LadyLike and a regular light beer,
          which one would you choose?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em Did you prefer the peach-flavored or the cantaloupe-flavored
          LadyLike?}
        \stopnarrow

        Once again the results of the focus group are compiled:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            47\textpercent{} of participants who normally choose white wine said
            that they would order LadyLike if it were available.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            54\textpercent{} said that they'd choose LadyLike over regular
            light-beer brands.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            82\textpercent{} preferred the peach flavor to the cantaloupe
            flavor.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Compelling results. The ABC executives' eyes light up as they imagine a
        double-digit growth in market share. They give LadyLike the go-ahead
        with a multimillion-dollar marketing budget to launch the product---and
        start thinking about how they are going to use their bonus money.

        Nine months later, accompanied by a multimillion-dollar multimedia
        marketing blitz, LadyLike beer hits bars and store shelves. But a few
        months after that, the majority of that initial shipment is still on
        those shelves. The few six-packs that managed to make it into household
        refrigerators are still there---with just one bottle missing. Despite
        all that market research and publicity, few women tried LadyLike, and
        even fewer came back
        for seconds. LadyLike's slogan should have been: \quotation{One sip and that's
        it.} The Law of Market Failure strikes again.

        The market focus group turned out to be a hocus-pocus group---a magic
        trick that made months of work and millions of dollars disappear in a
        puff of smoke.

        If I seem particularly harsh in my depiction of focus groups and similar
        Thoughtland-based market research and market-survey methods, it's only
        because I've heard too many stories from people who have been badly
        burned by such studies. They hired the best research firms, spent huge
        sums of money with them, and a few months later got impressive-looking
        reports---which pointed them in the wrong direction. I have fallen into
        the Thoughtland-based market-research trap a couple of times myself, and
        each time it cost me and my investors years of wasted effort and
        millions of dollars.

        Even if Thoughtland-based market research could produce more dependable
        results---and that's a gargantuan {\em if}---it still would not be my
        first choice, because there are, as you shall see, faster, cheaper, and
        far better ways to get the data we need. You can use the heel of an
        expensive Italian shoe to drive in a nail, but why abuse a Ferragamo
        when you have a proper hammer at your disposal?

        If your personal experience using this kind of market research (or using
        shoes as hammers) is more positive than mine, good for you---don't stop
        on my account. But augment it with the tools and techniques I am about
        to show you. In other words, run two parallel market-research efforts
        using both methods. If the results from the two approaches don't agree,
        it means that one of them is {\em lying} to you. When people need to
        make a major medical decision, they usually seek a second and even a
        third or fourth
        opinion. I suggest you do the same with your product decisions.

        As you might have guessed by now, I am rarely satisfied by just knowing
        facts; I want to understand the reasons and the mechanics behind those
        facts---the root causes. Especially when those facts run counter to
        common wisdom and practices. In this case, I wanted to understand why
        this Thoughtland-based market research---which is so common and seems so
        sensible on the surface---can produce such unreliable and untrustworthy
        results. So, once again, I went in search of answers.

        \section{The Four Trolls of Thoughtland}

        Thoughtland-based market-research tools such as focus groups and market
        surveys are a big business. It's not unheard of for companies to spend
        hundreds of thousands of dollars---even millions---on this type of
        research for a single new product. And, to be fair, well-planned and
        -executed market research of this kind can occasionally provide you with
        {\em some} interesting insights. But be very careful of how much weight
        you put on those insights, because these are Thoughtland-based tools
        and, because of that, they are subject to a variety of mental traps.

        The Beast of Failure does not work alone; it benefits from the
        mischievous doings of some devoted little helpers. These impish
        troll-like creatures dwell in Thoughtland where, through their trickery,
        they create all sorts of havoc with our ideas. Four of the most common
        problems caused by these mind-dwelling mini-monsters are:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            The Lost-in-Translation Problem
          \stopitem
          \startitem

        \stopenumerate

        Let's look at each of them in some detail.

        \subsection{The Lost-in-Translation Problem}

        The first problem we face in Thoughtland is one of communication. Until
        it's made concrete or tangible in some form, your idea for a new product
        or service is just an abstraction. It's something that you imagine or
        picture in your head in your own unique way. The moment you try to
        communicate what you see in your mind's eye to someone else, you run
        into a challenging translation problem---especially if your idea is new
        and different from anything else they've seen.

        This problem stems from the fact that the way you imagine the new
        product and its uses may be completely different from the way other
        people will imagine it after you describe it to them. Their
        interpretation of your idea is going to be distorted by their own mental
        trolls: their personal beliefs, preferences, and prejudices. Not only is
        their understanding of the idea itself likely to be different from
        yours, but they will {\em judge} the idea within the context of their
        unique mental model of the world.

        When I first heard about the car service Uber, for example, I was
        seriously skeptical about its chances for success. This is how I saw and
        judged the idea in my head:

        \startnarrow
          {\em You mean, strangers get into another stranger's car? Not a taxi
          with a licensed and professional driver, but just any car with any
          driver? Who's going to go for that? \quotation{Don't get into a stranger's car} is
          the first thing that my mother taught me! This is a crazy idea. It'll
          never work, and I'd never use it.}
        \stopnarrow

        In my own mind, Uber
        was about as unsafe as hitchhiking (for both the drivers and the
        passengers). Even as it gained in popularity, I thought that it would
        become at best a niche option for a small market---definitely not a
        threat to taxis, limos, or public transportation. A few months later, a
        friend convinced me to give Uber a try on my way back from the airport:
        \quotation{I bet you that you'll never set foot in a taxi again!}

        I downloaded the Uber app, and a few minutes later I was sitting in a
        black Toyota Prius driven by a friendly, chatty twentysomething who
        offered me candy and bottled water and got me home safely for half the
        cost of a taxi. Since then, Uber has become my default choice when I
        need a ride. A few years after I first taught my daughter never to get
        into a stranger's car, I told her that she should try Uber. Her reply?
        \quotation{Dad, I've been using Uber for months.} So much for parental advice and
        preconceived notions.

        \subsection{The Prediction Problem}

        Even if you manage to successfully communicate your idea without major
        distortions caused by the translation troll, you will run into another
        serious issue. People are notoriously bad at predicting whether they
        would actually want or like something they have not yet experienced---as
        well as how or how often they would actually use it.

        I was a teenager living in Italy when I first heard about sushi. A
        friend had returned from a trip to Japan and described dishes of raw
        tuna, salmon, eel, and even shrimp. I thought he was pulling my leg;
        uncooked fish sounded like a disgusting idea. But now I love sushi, and
        I try to eat it at least once a week.

        Let's go back to Uber for another example of the Prediction Problem.
        Even though I had come to terms with the whole idea of jumping in a car
        driven by a stranger who is neither a taxi nor
        a limo driver, I
        initially thought I'd be using the service exactly the same way I was
        using taxis and limos---once or twice every few weeks. Wrong
        prediction---way wrong. I find myself using Uber three to four times
        more often than I've ever used taxis.

        In another outcome I had not predicted, my daughter thought that using
        Uber all the time might prove easier and be more cost-effective than
        having her own car with all the traffic and parking hassles of San
        Francisco. To validate this Thoughtland-based scenario, she decided to
        run a six-month test to see if and how much she would miss having her
        own car and how the cost of using Uber would compare to the cost
        (insurance, maintenance, gas) of having her own car. She parked her
        Toyota in our driveway, dropped off her keys, and took an Uber back to
        her apartment. Six months later, she had the data she needed to make an
        informed decision. Much to her surprise and ours, she sold the car and,
        to this day, she has no plans to buy another one.

        Bottom line: as a species, we suck at predicting if, how, and how often
        we might use a new product or service.

        \subsection{The Skin-in-the-Game Problem}

        The concept of \quotation{skin in the game} is central to this book; you will see
        it come up several times. In case you are not familiar with the
        expression, {\em skin in the game} refers to the idea of having a vested
        interest in an outcome---something to lose or gain. For example, it's
        one thing to encourage your entrepreneur friend to quit her cushy job to
        start a new company because you think she will be hugely successful;
        it's a very different thing if you back your encouragement by offering
        to invest \textdollar{}10,000 of your own money in her new company. With \textdollar{}10,000
        of skin in the game, you will lose your investment if your friend's
        business fails.

        People love to give
        their opinions and advice; most of us do that without much thought if we
        have no skin in the game---because we've got nothing to lose or gain
        either way. Going back to the ABC LadyLike beer focus-group example, one
        of the main problems with this type of market research is that the
        participants don't have any stake in the outcome. If a focus-group
        participant gives enthusiastic responses to the survey questions and ABC
        fails with LadyLike beer, it's no foam off her nose. I'll have a lot
        more to say about skin in the game later on in the book.

        \subsection{The Confirmation-Bias Problem}

        The first three problems challenge the validity of the information we
        collect. This last one is a problem with how we interpret that
        information.

        The term {\em confirmation bias} refers to our (very human) tendency to
        seek evidence that confirms our existing beliefs or theories and to
        avoid or dismiss anything that runs counter to them. In other words, not
        only do we fail to look for objective ways to gather information, but we
        also fail to look objectively at the information we do get. We pick and
        choose and give more weight to bits of data that confirm our beliefs and
        dismiss those that run against them. That's why in the US, for example,
        most conservatives follow conservative news channels and most liberals
        follow liberal news channels.

        Most people don't like to have their beliefs challenged, let alone be
        proven totally wrong. Confirmation bias can and does affect the way we
        design our experiments, interpret the results, and come to conclusions.
        As cognitive and mathematical psychologist Amos Tverski put it: \quotation{Once we
        have adopted a particular hypothesis or interpretation, we grossly
        exaggerate the
        likelihood of that
        hypothesis, and find it very difficult to see things any other
        way.}\footnote{The problems that make
        Thoughtland-based market research so undependable for predicting market
        interest in a product belong to a family of cognitive errors and biases
        that are themselves the subject of much research. The book {\em
        Thinking, Fast and Slow} by Daniel Kahneman (New York: Farrar, Straus
        and Giroux, 2011) is a great resource if you need more evidence and
        examples of how our seemingly rational brain can fool most of us most of
        the time.}

        \subsection{When the Trolls Team Up}

        Every one of these four basic problems can by itself lead us to reach a
        wrong conclusion, and here's what happens when they are combined:

        \startnarrow
          First, the original idea is distorted in translation.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Then the distorted version of the idea is viewed and judged through each
          person's unique experiences and biases.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Next, a no-skin-in-the-game opinion is issued.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Finally, those no-risk opinions based on biased judgment of a distorted
          version of the idea are carefully selected and interpreted to confirm
          what we wanted to believe all along.
        \stopnarrow

        Bottom line: instead of dependable, objective, and actionable data,
        Thoughtland coughs up fur balls of subjective, biased, misguided, and
        misleading opinions.

        It's true that sometime these fur balls of opinion align and reflect the
        reality of the market---even a broken watch displays the correct time
        twice a day. But, more often than not, Thoughtland produces false
        positives and false negatives, that is, results suggesting the presence
        of a market that is {\em not} actually there or results suggesting the
        absence of a market that {\em is} actually there.

        \section{Thoughtland and False Positives}

        Thoughtland produces a false positive when your idea for a new product
        collects enough positive opinions and predictions to convince you that
        the idea is worth pursuing---perhaps even worth pursuing quickly and
        going all-in before someone else beats you to it. Armed with enthusiasm
        and a can't-fail attitude, you make a big investment to develop the
        idea, and a few months (or years) later you launch a beautiful and
        competently executed new product. And then~.~.~. nothing. All those
        glowing opinions and golden predictions, all those promises of \quotation{If you
        build it, I will come (or I will buy it, use it, adopt it)} never
        materialize---at least not in the numbers you were expecting.

        How common are false positives caused by Thoughtland? Based on the hard
        fact that most new products fail in the market, I'd say they are as
        common as roaches in New York City. Whenever you read about the
        surprising failure of an exciting and promising new product, chances are
        that you are reading about such a scenario. And, like roaches, for every
        such story that you read about, you can bet that there are hundreds more
        that you never see.

        Dramatic examples of false positives can be found in every industry and
        business, but I've chosen a particularly juicy one, an oldie but goodie,
        to illustrate my point: a not so little startup called Webvan.

        In the late 1990s, around the time when Amazon (a great example of The
        Right It built right) was beginning to seriously disrupt book and CD
        retailers with its new online store, a group of smart, successful, and
        experienced people were convinced that the grocery business was ripe for
        an Amazon-like disruption. It sounded like a sure bet. After all, most
        households spend
        considerably more on
        groceries than they do on books or CDs. Furthermore, since shopping for
        cauliflower and cheddar cheese at a supermarket is far less fun and
        exciting than shopping for books or CDs, it was logical to expect an
        even faster and deeper market adoption.

        It makes perfect sense. I love hanging around and browsing at
        bookstores, and I look forward to the experience---not so with
        supermarkets. Overall, the online grocery business appeared to be a
        once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, with a market that was considerably
        bigger and even more compelling than the market Amazon was in. Or so
        Webvan thought~.~.~. in Thoughtland.

        Based on that, Webvan's founders decided to create a new company that
        would make it easy for people to order groceries online and have them
        delivered to their home at a specified time by a fleet of vans. Almost
        everyone who heard about the idea---business analysts, grocery-business
        consultants, internet pundits---agreed that this was a huge market
        opportunity. More important, most of the potential customers interviewed
        had the same enthusiastic response: \quotation{That would be awesome. I hate
        shopping for groceries, waiting in line, schlepping them to my car, and
        so on.}

        In other words, lots of excitement, promises, and hot air, but no skin
        in the game. By the way, as a potential customer, I had exactly the same
        reaction as most other people. I was already addicted to Amazon, and I
        couldn't wait for Webvan to launch. I had predicted not only that Webvan
        would be a huge success, but that our household would make the shift and
        do most of our grocery shopping online.

        As far as Thoughtland was concerned, there wasn't a single cloud on the
        horizon. All Webvan had to do was execute well---but also fast, before
        someone else jumped on this can't-lose
        opportunity. After
        securing an initial round of funding of over \textdollar{}100 million from some of
        the best VCs in the industry, Webvan went on a turbocharged hiring,
        shopping, and building spree. It recruited hundreds of people, signed up
        dozens of partners, bought or built huge refrigerated warehouses, and of
        course purchased an impressive fleet of vans and trucks, which were
        painted beige with a huge company logo on the side. Eventually Webvan
        raised---and spent---over \textdollar{}800 million.

        You can guess where this is going. Webvan launched with great fanfare
        and publicity. But somehow all those Thoughtland promises of masses of
        consumers forgoing checkout lines to do their regular grocery shopping
        online never materialized---at least in nowhere near the numbers
        predicted by their Thoughtland-based research. For whatever reason, even
        though the internet proved great for selling books and CDs, it did not,
        at least at the time, prove to be a great channel for grocery shopping.

        In 2001, roughly two years after it started operations, Webvan filed for
        bankruptcy. Some of the company's beige vans, which were sold at
        bankruptcy auctions, can still be seen driving around Silicon Valley.
        You can even make out a faint outline of the Webvan logo---a ghostly
        reminder of what can happen when you put too much trust and spend too
        much time in Thoughtland.

        \section{Thoughtland and False Negatives}

        We have seen how false positives can convince you to overinvest in a new
        product idea that turns out to be The Wrong It. False negatives have the
        opposite result; they convince you to abandon an idea that would have
        turned out to be The Right It.

        Here's how the
        false-negative scenario typically unfolds. You have what you think is a
        great idea: a new way to solve a common problem, a new market
        opportunity, a great plot for a thriller. Barely able to contain your
        excitement, you take your idea on a road trip through Thoughtland. You
        share it with family, friends, possible partners or investors, potential
        users---anyone who will listen. You explain your idea with the
        enthusiasm of a freshman cheerleader who has had one Frappuccino too
        many. But instead of sharing your vision and excitement, most people
        don't get your idea: \quotation{Why would anyone want to use that?} \quotation{That's a
        stupid idea.} \quotation{Keep your day job.} And so on.

        At first, you manage to absorb a few blows. You remember that line from
        Rudyard Kipling's poem \quotation{If}: \quotation{If you can trust yourself when all men
        doubt you.} So you pick yourself up and keep going. But after a few more
        poundings, you remember the next line from the poem: \quotation{But make allowance
        for their doubting too.} You allow some doubt to creep in and, soon
        after, you decide to drop your idea and wonder what on earth made you
        think that something like that would even work.

        A year or so later, you read about someone else succeeding with that
        very same idea. Thoughtland has produced another false negative and
        claimed another victim.

        If you are reading this book, you are probably the type of person who
        regularly comes up with ideas for new products and businesses, and I bet
        that false-negative story I just described sounds familiar to you. I've
        been through this scenario myself too many times to count. On some
        occasions, I was the one with the idea being dismissed and ridiculed; on
        other occasions, I was the one doing the dismissing. Let me share more
        examples with you.

        When I was offered the opportunity to join a little-known
        startup called Google
        as the company's first engineering director, almost all my friends and
        former colleagues thought it would be a bad move. In their opinion,
        there were already several well-established search engines (remember
        Alta Vista?) and other, even better portals to the web such as Yahoo! In
        other words, that market was already spoken for and saturated.

        I ignored their opinions and joined Google anyway. A few months later, I
        tried to get a good friend to join me and work in the Google ads team. I
        told him that we were building one of the most amazing money-making
        machines ever developed and that in a few years it would generate
        billions of dollars. His response was: \quotation{It may make a few bucks, but I
        don't think it will be big at all. I never click on online ads.}

        Another friend I tried to recruit chose a lesser position at Yahoo! In
        his opinion, Google was a minor internet player and would remain one. He
        thought that Google's minimalistic home page was a stupid waste of
        valuable screen real estate compared to Yahoo's
        everything-but-the-kitchen-sink landing page and that its PageRank
        algorithm was inferior to Yahoo's manually curated results.

        In Google's case, I made the right bet, and those two friends are still
        licking their wounds. But I've been on the wrong side of the fence many
        times myself. Here's a short list of relatively recent ideas I snickered
        at when I first heard them, along with my initial reaction:

        \startnarrow
          Twitter: Who'd want to follow people like me? Heck, I don't even want to
          be followed. And what's with that 140-character limit anyway?
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Uber: No thanks. If I can't find a taxi and can't afford a limo, I'd
          rather take the bus than hop in a car driven by an
          unlicensed stranger.
          What's next, go spend the night in a stranger's bedroom?
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Airbnb: You mean that people rent rooms to virtual strangers for the
          night? I can't imagine enough people willing to open their home like
          that or enough people willing to go to sleep in a stranger's home. Have
          you ever watched a horror movie?
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Tesla's original Roadster: \textdollar{}120,000 for an all-electric two-seater that
          runs on batteries? I can buy a Porsche or a used Ferrari for that kind
          of cash.
        \stopnarrow

        I could go on for pages, but you get the point. I should add that I was
        far from alone with my negative initial opinion about the aforementioned
        ideas and companies; most of the people I talked to had similar
        reactions. It happens all the time, to most new ideas.

        Just this morning, I read that Amazon agreed to buy
        Ring,\footnote{Ali Montag, \quotation{Amazon Is
        Buying Ring, a Business That Was Once Rejected on \quote{Shark Tank,}} CNBC,
        February 27, 2018,
        \goto{\hyphenatedurl{https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/amazon-buys-ring-a-former-shark-tank-reject.html}}[url(https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/amazon-buys-ring-a-former-shark-tank-reject.html)].} a company that
        makes wi-fi--enabled video doorbells and other home security products.
        The acquisition price has not been disclosed yet, but it's rumored to be
        in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Why do I mention Ring? Because
        just few years earlier Ring's founder and CEO, Jamie Siminoff, couldn't
        convince anyone to invest in his video doorbell idea. He couldn't even
        get a deal on the popular TV show {\em Shark Tank}. In fact, one of the
        show's savviest investors and an expert in television infomercials, Lori
        Greiner, the \quotation{Queen of QVC TV,} made the comment: \quotation{You'll never be able
        to sell this on QVC.}

        In a recent QVC
        appearance, Siminoff said that he sold 140,000 units of his video
        doorbell (\textdollar{}22.5 million worth) in twenty-four hours---one of the most
        successful QVC sales of the year. Oops. Add to that a couple of other
        million units sold through various outlets, and what we have is another
        spectacular false negative courtesy of Thoughtland. If a tank full of
        sharks can get it so wrong, what chance do we little guppies have?

        \section{Escape from Thoughtland}

        When you combine the Law of Market Failure and Thoughtland, chances are
        that you will be a victim of one of two possible scenarios:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Disregard for the Law of Market Failure combined with false-positive
            responses from Thoughtland leads you to overinvest in The Wrong
            It---an idea that is destined to fail.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Fear of failure combined with false-negative feedback from Thoughtland
            stops you from pursuing an idea that has the potential to be The Right
            It---an idea that, if competently executed, is destined to succeed.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        As I've already mentioned, opinions from Thoughtland and the real world
        do align sometimes. False positives and false negatives are the norm,
        but {\em true} positives and {\em true} negatives do happen.

        Sometimes, an idea gets an enthusiastic response in Thoughtland, is
        launched based on that, and succeeds. \quotation{I knew that this was going to be
        big!} And sometimes an idea gets slammed in Thoughtland, is executed
        despite the negative reactions, and
        flops miserably.
        \quotation{Told you so. Do you think you can get your old job back?}

        How can you know if the negative or positive responses you are getting
        from Thoughtland are true or false? My conclusion is that you can't.
        Given the Lost-in-Translation Problem, the Prediction Problem, the
        No-Skin-in-the-Game Problem, and the Confirmation-Bias Problem, there
        are too many ways to misjudge an idea's likelihood for success.

        But if you can't trust your opinions, other people's opinions, or even
        the opinions of experts, how can you decide if the idea you have and
        would like to develop is likely to succeed?

        You need data!
      \stopchapter

      \startchapter[title={Data Beats Opinions},reference=chapter:3]
        The title for this chapter, \quotation{Data Beats Opinions,} comes from one of
        Google's key operational principles. I had always believed that, being a
        rational guy, I had been making most of my work-related decisions based
        on data and hard facts. It wasn't until I started working at Google in
        2001 that I realized how much my own opinions, preferences, and biases
        affected my decision process. I won't go as far as saying that opinions
        carried zero weight at Google, but after a few meetings I learned that
        if I could not support my opinions with sufficient objective data, I had
        little chance of winning arguments or convincing my colleagues.

        Not only that, but I also learned that the company's data-driven
        decision process was very exacting. What most people would consider data
        did not pass muster at Google. In order to get serious consideration in
        the decision process, the data had to satisfy a number of key criteria:

        \startconcept{Freshness:}
          The data has to be fresh---the fresher the better.
          That's because what was true a few years (or months or weeks) ago may
          not be true today. This is particularly important in
          high-tech businesses
          and the online world, where people's attitudes and expectations change
          the most rapidly. In the late 1990s, for example, one of the performance
          rules of thumb for websites was that a page had to load in eight seconds
          or less. Data from a widely publicized study showed that if a web page
          took longer than eight seconds to load, at least 50\textpercent{} of
          the website visitors would lose patience and leave the site.

          These days, those eight seconds would feel like an eternity to
          90\textpercent{} of users. We expect web pages to load instantly, and
          if they take more than a couple of seconds, we are gone. The
          \quotation{eight-second rule} became the \quotation{two-second rule,} and in a few years it
          will probably be the \quotation{half-second rule.} Some types of data spoil faster
          than a banana left in the back seat of a hot car; others remain valid
          longer. Unfortunately, unlike ripe bananas, aging data does not develop
          brown spots and go mushy to alert you, nor does it come with a helpful
          expiration date. So it's up to you to be careful with the data you
          choose to use. If in doubt about its freshness, throw it out.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Strong relevance:}
          The data must be directly applicable to the
          specific product or decision being evaluated. This may sound like an
          obvious criterion, but you'd be surprised how often data with weak
          relevance can trickle into the decision process. The fact that, say,
          most McDonald's customers would not order onion rings with their burgers
          even if they were offered does not mean that you should not include them
          on the menu for {\em your} idea for a burger food truck.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Known provenance:}
          You should not rely on data collected from other
          people, in other organizations, or for other projects to make your
          decisions. Who knows what methods those people used to collect and
          filter the data? And who knows what biases,
          influences, and
          motivations may have affected them when they compiled and summarized the
          data? The \quotation{eight-second rule} and other similar studies mentioned
          before, for example, were sponsored and publicized by companies that
          sold products and services to accelerate website performance; so they
          had a vested interested in showing data that supported their business
          offering. Make sure you know where your data comes from and how it was
          collected and filtered.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Statistical significance:}
          The data must be statistically
          significant. It must be based on a sufficiently large sample to ensure
          that the result cannot be attributed to chance. And unless you want to
          be humiliated in front of your colleagues, don't try to present personal
          experiences or one-off stories as data. I made that mistake twice in my
          early tenure at Google, and both times I was quickly reprimanded with a
          chorus of \quotation{Anecdotes are not data.}
        \stopconcept

        To be clear, nobody at Google sat me down and formally walked me through
        such a list of criteria. But after a few meetings, I learned that the
        term {\em data} in \quotation{data beats opinions} meant {\em fresh, relevant,
        trustworthy, and statistically significant data}. I also learned that
        the quickest and most reliable way to get that kind of data was to
        collect that data myself. As a result, I developed a deep-seated
        distrust of Other People's Data.

        \section{Other People's Data}

        You should not rely on Other People's Data (OPD) to determine whether
        your idea is likely to succeed in the market. It's a tempting, but lazy
        and dangerous shortcut.

        First, let me define
        what I mean by Other People's Data. OPD is {\em any market data
        collected and compiled by other people, for other projects, at other
        times, in other places, with other methods, and for other purposes}. OPD
        violates one or more of the criteria of freshness, relevance,
        trustworthiness, and significance that we've just outlined. The data
        derived from the experiments, actions, and decisions of other people
        working on ideas similar to yours can be used to {\em supplement} and
        {\em inform} your own actions and decisions. But it's {\em not
        sufficient} and it should {\em not be a substitute} for collecting your
        own data. Let me explain why.

        Whenever you think you have a new idea for a business, product, or
        service, there are five possible scenarios:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            You are the first person in history to come up with that idea. There's
            nothing in the world like it.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Other people have had the same or a similar idea and
            \startenumerate
              \startitem
                they chose not to pursue it.
              \stopitem
              \startitem
                they are actively pursuing it, but have not launched it yet.
              \stopitem
              \startitem
                they pursued it, launched it, and failed.
              \stopitem
              \startitem
                they pursued it, launched it, and succeeded.
              \stopitem
            \stopenumerate
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        Let's examine each of these scenarios more closely:

        \startconcept{Scenario 1:}
          You are the first to come up with that idea. This
          scenario is extremely unlikely. I know that because I am constantly
          trying to come up with new and unique, but somewhat plausible product
          ideas to use as examples in my pretotyping classes and workshops, and
          it's a nearly impossible task. Even when I push the limits of
          plausibility, tastefulness, or ethics (\fsp{e.g.}, beer for dogs, squirrel
          burgers, cat cloning), I find that someone has beaten me to it.
          Furthermore, even
          with all the information now available on the internet, there's no way
          of knowing for sure that nobody else is thinking or secretly working on
          a similar idea somewhere in the world. In the extremely unlikely event
          that you are indeed the first person in the world to think of a totally
          new idea, you don't need to worry about OPD anyway---because there is
          none. You are in virgin territory, and you will have to collect every
          bit of data yourself.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Scenario 2a:}
          Others have had a similar idea and chose not to
          pursue it. This scenario provides us with zero applicable data. The fact
          that nobody else decided to develop an idea similar to yours does not
          mean that that idea cannot succeed in the market---if competently
          executed. Coming up with new ideas is easy; pursuing them requires
          effort, sacrifices, skin in the game, and more. Most people have lots of
          ideas but don't do anything about them; that may tell you something
          about those people, but it tells you nothing about the idea's potential
          for success.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Scenario 2b:}
          Others are actively pursuing a similar idea, but they
          haven't launched it yet. This scenario also fails to provide us with any
          meaningful market data because, unless you spy on them, you can't know
          how similar their idea is to yours, what market tests and experiments
          (if any) they ran to inform their decision, what their risk tolerance
          is, and so on.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Scenario 2c:}
          Others pursued a similar idea, launched it, and
          failed. This scenario provides us with {\em some} data, but not enough
          to make a decision based on it. They may have botched one or more
          aspects of their execution, or their
          product may have
          differed from your idea in a small but meaningful way. Not to mention
          the fact that if that idea was tried at some other time, in another
          location, or on a different population, their results may not apply to
          your idea and target market. The history of business is full of ideas
          that failed at some time or in some place, but flourished at other times
          and in other places. McDonald's McSpaghetti, for example, flopped in
          most countries, but is, believe it or not, popular in the Philippines.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Scenario 2d:}
          Others pursued a similar idea, launched it, and
          succeeded. This case provides us with potentially relevant market data,
          but not enough to make a decision based on it. Just because someone
          succeeds with an idea does not mean that {\em you} will succeed with a
          similar idea. The fact that, in 1983, Stephen King's book about a
          homicidal car, {\em Christine}, sold well and was even made into a movie
          does not mean that {\em Madeline}, Alberto Savoia's idea for book about
          a murderous motorcycle, will succeed.
        \stopconcept

        The bottom line is this. You should not make a decision about your idea
        based solely on what other people did or did not do with an idea similar
        to yours. Their experience, results, and data are not necessarily
        applicable to your idea.

        Am I telling you to ignore any and all data from other people who have
        pursued ideas and markets similar to yours? Not exactly. I am not
        telling you to completely ignore it, because there may be something,
        perhaps even a lot, that you can learn from OPD. But I am telling you
        not to depend on it, because OPD is not sufficient. When it comes to
        determining the market potential of a new idea, OPD is simply not
        enough, and it's no substitute for {\em your own data}.

        \section{You Must Get Your Own DAta}

        Your Own DAta (YODA) is market data collected firsthand by {\em your
        own} team to validate {\em your own} idea. To qualify as YODA, the data
        must satisfy the criteria of freshness, relevance, trustworthiness, and
        significance. YODA is the opposite of OPD---and heaps more valuable. OPD
        may seem easier to collect, especially with all the data available
        online these days. But don't be lured by the ease with which you can
        obtain it, because an ounce of YODA is worth a ton of OPD. And the best
        news is that collecting YODA is neither difficult nor time consuming nor
        expensive. In fact, getting fresh YODA is often easier, faster, and more
        fun than digging out and dusting off some stale OPD---especially if you
        use the tools and tactics you will learn in \in{Parts}[part:2]
        and \in[part:3].

        \section{Quick Recap}

        In \in{Part}[part:1], we spent a lot of time
        learning about failure. This may not have been the most encouraging way
        to start, but understanding how and why most new products fail in the
        market is a key prerequisite for appreciating and understanding the
        tools, techniques, and tactics you will learn in \in{Parts}[part:2]
        and \in[part:3]. Before we proceed, however, let
        me take a moment to summarize what we've learned so far.

        Here are the main takeaways from \in{Part}[part:1],
        worth repeating, memorizing, and perhaps
        tattooing somewhere on your body as a reminder:

          \startitem
            Most new ideas fail
            in the market because they are The Wrong It---ideas that the market is
            not interested in regardless of how well they are executed.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Your best chance for succeeding in the market is to combine an idea
            that is The Right It with competent execution.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            You cannot depend on your intuition, other people's opinions, or other
            people's data to determine if a new idea is The Right It.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            The most reliable way to determine if a new idea is likely to be The
            Right It is to collect Your Own DAta (YODA).

        \stopitemize

        In \in{Part}[part:2] of this book, I will
        introduce you to three categories of tools and techniques to help you
        collect, analyze, and interpret your own data: {\em thinking tools}, to
        help clarify your idea and identify the data you need to collect; {\em
        pretotyping tools}, to help you test your idea in the market so you can
        collect YODA efficiently; and {\em analysis tools}, to help you
        interpret the data you collect with objectivity and help you translate
        that data into decisions.

    \startpart[title={Sharp Tools},reference=part:2]
      \startchapter[title={Thinking Tools},reference=chapter:4]
        We've seen what can happen in Thoughtland when you combine fuzzy
        thinking with a lack of reality checks. We will address reality checks a
        bit later; first we need to fix the way we think about our ideas for new
        products.

        {\em Clarity of thought is paramount}. If your new product idea is
        vague, imprecise, ambiguous, or open to multiple interpretations, then
        you don't have a solid foundation for going forward. Before you can put
        an idea to the test, you must be able to articulate it with enough
        clarity and precision to guide the design of meaningful and revealing
        tests, tests whose results you can trust.

        In the next few sections, you will learn a set of proven concepts and
        tools designed to de-fuzz, clarify, and sharpen your thinking. Let's
        begin with the all-important and all-powerful Market Engagement
        Hypothesis.

        \section{Market Engagement Hypothesis}

        Remember the Success Equation from Part I?

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Right A \textmultiply{} Right B \textmultiply{} Right C \textmultiply{} Right D \textmultiply{} Right E, \fsp{etc.} = Success}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        For an idea to succeed in the market, a number of key factors must line
        up just right. It's not enough to have what you think is a great concept
        for a new restaurant; you must also hire competent kitchen staff and
        servers, run an effective marketing campaign to build some buzz, get an
        initial set of positive reviews, and hope that Gordon Ramsay does not
        open a competing restaurant across the street. But, as we've seen,
        competent execution, experience, and even good luck can't help you if
        your idea is not The Right It. If your chef or staff turn out to be
        unreliable, you can replace them. If your first marketing campaign
        fizzles, you can run another campaign. But if your restaurant
        premise---the concept itself---is The Wrong It, what are you going to
        do? Change people's minds? Good luck with that!

        When the market believes, rightly or wrongly, that a restaurant called
        Cheapo Sushi sounds like an open invitation for food poisoning and
        decides to not even give it a try, you are done. If the market does not
        want to engage with your idea, you can't force it to. Let me put it as
        succinctly as I can: {\em If there's no market, there's no way.}

        But what is your market? And how do you define and determine engagement?
        You need to be 100 percent clear about these questions. Enter the Market
        Engagement Hypothesis, which I will abbreviate as MEH (a suitable
        acronym since, thanks to {\em The Simpsons} TV show, the exclamation
        \quotation{meh} has entered our lexicon as a way to express a lack of interest or
        enthusiasm---which, more often
        than not, is exactly
        how the market responds to most new ideas).

        The Market Engagement Hypothesis identifies your key belief or
        assumption about how the market will engage with your idea. Will they
        want to learn more about it, explore it, try it, adopt it, buy it? And
        if they adopt it, try it, or buy it, how are they going to use it and
        how often? Will they buy it again or recommend it to friends? In other
        words, the MEH articulates your vision of how the market will respond to
        and use your idea.

        If your MEH turns out to be wrong, then it's possible that your vision
        is just a hallucination or wishful thinking. In that case, you better
        revisit it, tweak it, or move on to a different idea. But if your MEH is
        right, you have a fighting chance against the Law of Market Failure.

        Because the MEH is so important, it should not only be clear, but it
        should also be testable and expressed using numbers wherever possible.
        But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Let me begin by showing you
        what typical Market Engagement Hypotheses look like, and then I'll show
        you how to make them better. Here are some examples that we can use as a
        starting point:

        \startconcept{Idea:}
          Cheapo Sushi, a cheap sushi food truck, home of the 99\textcent{} tuna
          roll
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{MEH:}
          If we make sushi as fast and as inexpensive as other fast
          food, many sushi lovers will choose it over burgers, tacos, or less
          healthy options
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:}
          Webvan, online ordering and home delivery of groceries
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{MEH:}
          Given the option, lots of households will regularly choose to
          buy groceries online instead of going to the supermarket
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:}
          A movie
          based on the Marvel cartoon character Howard the Duck
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{MEH:}
          People love fictional ducks (Donald Duck, Daffy Duck), so
          they will flock (sorry!) to see a live-action movie featuring Howard the
          Duck
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:}
          Netflix (the company's original DVD-based business
          model---before streaming)
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{MEH:}
          If we combine mail-based delivery of DVDs with a flat monthly
          rate and no late-return fees, a lot of people will sign up with us
          instead of renting from video stores
        \stopconcept

        You get the idea. The Market Engagement Hypothesis is a short sentence
        that encapsulates the basic premise of your idea along with how you
        expect the market to engage with it.

        I have to confess that while I was developing the MEH concept, I was
        terribly tempted to use the word {\em hope} or {\em hallucination}
        instead of {\em hypothesis} (as in Market Engagement Hope or Market
        Engagement Hallucination). Most of the time either one of those terms
        would be a more accurate description of how people ruminating on their
        idea in Thoughtland imagine the market will engage with their idea---a
        blend of hopeful thinking and hallucination:

        \startnarrow
          Everyone at the office loves my low-fat vegan kale cookies. They all
          tell me I should go into business to sell them. Oh, and a neighbor of
          mine who works at Whole Foods said that this is exactly the kind of
          baked goods their customers are asking for. She said I could easily sell
          them for \textdollar{}3 each! So I am going to quit my job, take a second
          mortgage on our
          house, invest in commercial-grade baking equipment, hire a few people to
          help me, and three months from now I'll be rolling in kale-cookie dough!
        \stopnarrow

        Add tangerine trees, marmalade skies, a girl with kaleidoscope eyes,
        and, well, let's just say that when it comes to ideas for new products
        or businesses, most of us don't need LSD to have hallucinations. Over
        the years, I've had several such hallucinations myself.

        The problem is that sometimes those hallucinations become reality.
        Sometimes your imagined market materializes just as you expected. And
        once in a while the market turns out to be much bigger and much hungrier
        for your new product than you or anyone else could have imagined. In
        other words, sometimes your Market Engagement Hypothesis turns out to be
        correct---your idea is The Right It. Of course, you will still have to
        execute competently, and many obstacles still stand between you and
        market success, but over the years I've learned to count on the
        following fact: {\em If there's a market, there's a way.}

        If there's real demand for inexpensive sushi, one way or another Cheapo
        Sushi will find a supply of low-cost fish, so it can offer a tuna roll
        for 99\textcent{}. People can be very creative and will usually find a solution
        once they have hard evidence (not just belief or hope) of market demand
        for their product. Formulating the precise definition and finding proof
        of existence of that market demand are exactly what the Market
        Engagement Hypothesis is designed to help us do. It's an important tool
        and a nonnegotiable first step in beating the Law of Market Failure.

        Now that you have a general idea of what a Market Engagement Hypothesis
        looks like, let's learn how to turn it into one of those sharp tools I
        promised you. It all begins with numbers.

        \section{Say It with Numbers}

        Are you familiar with the saying \quotation{Not everything that counts can be
        counted, and not everything that can be counted counts}? It's a good
        quote---words to live by. But this is also true: \quotation{Some things that count
        {\em can} be counted---and {\em should} be counted.}

        One of the most valuable habits I acquired by working at Google is to
        avoid vague terms and to use numbers whenever possible. If \quotation{data beats
        opinions,} then the best way to express that data is to {\em say it with
        numbers}. For example, instead of blurting out, \quotation{I believe that if we
        make the \quote{Subscribe} buttons a little wider, we'll get a few more clicks
        on them,} a well-trained Google employee would transform \quotation{a little
        wider} and \quotation{a few more clicks} into specific quantities, turning that
        fuzzy opinion into a testable hypothesis:

        \startconcept{Fuzzy opinion:} I believe that if we make our \quotation{Subscribe} buttons a
          little wider, we'll get a few more clicks on them.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Testable hypothesis:} If we make our \quotation{Subscribe} buttons
          20\textpercent{} wider, we will get at least 10\textpercent{} more
          subscribers.
        \stopconcept

        By saying it with numbers, a fuzzy belief becomes a clearly stated
        hypothesis that can be tested. In this case, an obvious experiment would
        be to split users into two groups: group A (original button size) and
        group B (a 20\textpercent{} wider button), and to compare the clicks
        between the two groups.

        \startconcept{Test results:} Using a sample of 1,000 page views, we conducted an
          A/B test. The results indicate that when we increased the width of the
          \quotation{Subscribe} button by 20\textpercent{} (from 100 to 120 pixels), we
          got 14\textpercent{} more subscribers.
        \stopconcept

        If these initial
        results hold up after a few more tests, the team will have compelling
        evidence---YODA, not opinions or speculations---that a bigger button
        will result in more subscriptions.

        Fuzzy thinking, along with opinions, is like catnip for the Beast of
        Failure---an open and irresistible invitation for trouble. Nothing
        removes fuzziness from your thinking like numbers; and the best part is
        that those numbers can be just rough estimates at first. In fact, it's a
        mistake to use more precision than the situation allows. That's why in
        the example above we used round numbers (\fsp{e.g.}, 20\textpercent{},
        10\textpercent{}) in the initial hypothesis. At that point we were
        just making an educated guess, and it would have been premature and
        presumptuous (not to mention ridiculous) to use more precise
        numbers---that's what experiments are for. For example, after several
        more rounds of testing we might learn that the optimal width for
        \quotation{Subscribe} buttons is 124 pixels (24\textpercent{} wider than the
        current size) and that such an increase in size will generate an average
        of 13.8\textpercent{} more clicks.

        Now that you know what I mean by \quotation{say it with numbers,} let's apply this
        approach to our Market Engagement Hypothesis.

        \subsection{XYZ Hypothesis}

        The Market Engagement Hypothesis is a critical first step and an
        essential tool. But, like a pair of scissors or a knife, if our tool is
        not sharp enough, it won't be very useful. The way we sharpen a Market
        Engagement Hypothesis is by rewriting it using another tool: the XYZ
        Hypothesis. I developed this tool out of frustration during one of my
        office-hours sessions at Stanford. Here's what happened.

        I was trying to get a small team of engineering students to apply \quotation{say
        it with numbers} to the Market Engagement Hypothesis for their personal
        air-pollution monitor idea. The students
        kept coming up with
        fuzzy descriptions of what they thought their market was and how
        potential customers would engage with their product. Here's an example
        of what the students were coming up with:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Some people who live in very polluted cities would be interested in
          a reasonably priced device to help them monitor and avoid air
          pollution.}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        How many people is \quotation{some people}? What cities qualify as \quotation{very
        polluted}? What does \quotation{would be interested} imply? What does \quotation{reasonably
        priced} mean?

        We were meeting on campus in a whiteboard-lined room, where a previous
        group of students had left a bunch of mathematical equations on the
        board. I looked at those equations and had an idea. I jumped off my
        chair, grabbed a marker, went to the whiteboard, and wrote out the
        following:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf At least X\textpercent{} of Y will Z.}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Then I explained: \quotation{X\textpercent{} is a specific percentage of your
        target market. Y is a clear description of your target market. Z is how
        you expect the market will engage with your idea. As you may recall from
        your high-school algebra, X, Y, and Z are the letters we use to
        represent unknown variables. And at this point that's exactly where your
        idea stands---you are dealing with many unknown variables. But you can
        begin by making educated guesses about those unknown variables, running
        some simple experiments to test your initial hypothesis, and making
        adjustments as necessary.}

        Finally, the students smiled and nodded---I was speaking their language.
        After a few iterations the fuzziness was eliminated, and they had a
        respectable, testable, say-it-with-numbers hypothesis:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf At least {\em
          10\textpercent{} of people who live in cities with an AQI level
          greater than 100 will buy a \textdollar{}120 portable pollution sensor} (where AQI
          stands for Air Quality Index, an objective measure of air pollution).}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Note that the initial values for X, Y, and Z were just starting
        points---best guesses based on the minimum market size the students
        believed they needed for their idea to be viable. Is 10\textpercent{}
        a good estimate of the market? Is greater than 100 the right AQI? Is
        \textdollar{}120 the right price? Probably not. These initial numbers may prove to
        be way off, but at least the students defined what \quotation{some people,} \quotation{very
        polluted,} \quotation{would be interested,} and \quotation{reasonably priced} meant to them,
        and they could test to see if the market agreed.

        In addition to having the virtue of being testable, the XYZ Hypothesis
        is a great tool for getting teams to make their implicit assumptions
        explicit. One student's version of reasonably priced was \textdollar{}200, while
        another one thought that they could not possibly reach
        10\textpercent{} of the market at that price and that the device would
        have to cost \textdollar{}80 to \textdollar{}100. The two students didn't know that they had
        different ideas about pricing, but when forced to put a number to
        \quotation{reasonably priced,} the disagreement was unmasked. Which student's
        price is right? We don't know---perhaps neither. It's quite possible
        that no significant market exists at either price point or at any price
        point. It's quite possible that people are simply not interested---for
        whatever set of reasons---in a portable pollution detection device.
        Ultimately, the market will decide what \quotation{reasonably priced} means; but
        for the time being the students met halfway and compromised on an
        initial price of \textdollar{}120.

        The XYZ Hypothesis format proved to be a wonderful
        \quotation{de-fuzzer.} It
        replaced broad and imprecise terms (\quotation{some,} \quotation{very,} \quotation{reasonable}) with
        precise counterparts and the vague notion of \quotation{interested} with the
        specific action \quotation{buy} at the specific price of \quotation{\textdollar{}120.}

        \startplacetable

            \stopxtablebody
          \stopxtable
        \stopplacetable

        After that first success, I suspected that the XYZ Hypothesis format
        would prove to be a valuable tool, so I asked one of the students to
        take a photo of the whiteboard to commemorate that {\em Eureka!} moment.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/p70.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        And I am really glad
        to have that memento now, because my suspicion proved correct. The XYZ
        Hypothesis has become a permanent and valuable part of my toolkit and
        one of the first things I teach. In fact, if I only have a few minutes
        to help aspiring entrepreneurs or product managers, I use that time to
        explain XYZ Hypothesis and help them express their idea using it---and
        it always succeeds in clarifying their thinking and bringing to the
        surface any misunderstandings or disagreements among team members.

        \subsection{Venture into the Unknown}

        As I've already briefly mentioned, X, Y, and Z are the letters
        conventionally used in science and mathematics to represent unknown
        variables. The letter X, in particular, is often used (even in popular
        culture) to represent mysteries, elements that we don't yet fully
        understand or whose existence we cannot prove: {\em The X Factor, The X
        Files, Planet X.}

        That which we don't know or fully understand represents both a danger
        and an opportunity. This makes these three letters very appropriate for
        our task, because bringing a new product to market is akin to a journey
        into the unknown---a journey that could bring us great rewards or result
        in failure. It's like entering a colossal dark cave that is both full of
        treasures and full of traps---home to the Beast of Failure and the
        trolls of Thoughtland.

        X, Y, and Z are also used to describe, measure, and graph things in
        three-dimensional space. In our case, the unknown three-dimensional XYZ
        space we are exploring and want to map and understand consists of:

        \startconcept{X:} How {\em big} a slice, what percent, of our target market can
          we capture?
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Y:} What {\em
          is} our target market?
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Z:} {\em How} and exactly {\em to what extent} will the target
          market engage with our product?
        \stopconcept

        No sane explorer would venture into the unknown without the basic tools
        (compass, sextant, charting kit, \fsp{etc.}) needed to track his or her
        position and measure progress. The XYZ Hypothesis is the first tool in
        our market exploration toolkit. And it's an essential one, because it
        gives us an objective way to measure and map our steps into that dark
        unknown that is the market.

        \subsection{XYZ Hypothesis Examples}

        Market Engagement Hypothesis and the XYZ Hypothesis are so important
        that I want to make sure you understand them well. So here are a few
        more examples of how to use the XYZ Hypothesis format to clarify a fuzzy
        Market Engagement Hypothesis. All examples are based on ideas that have
        come up during my lectures, coaching sessions, or brainstorming
        exercises. They are meant for illustrative purposes only. Don't focus on
        the actual ideas or how silly they might appear to you, but rather on
        how they are expressed in XYZ format. And, yes, I know that some of
        these ideas have actually been tried.

        \startconcept{Idea:} An Uber-like service that picks up and delivers laundry
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Fuzzy MEH:} Most people who use coin laundries dread the
          experience. Many of them would pay a few extra dollars to have their
          laundry picked up, washed, dried, and returned in a reasonable amount of
          time.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{XYZ Hypothesis:} At least 10\textpercent{} of coin laundry users
          will pay \textdollar{}5 extra to
          have their laundry picked up and returned within twenty-four hours.
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:} An ice cube--based air cooler for cars that don't have air
          conditioning
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Fuzzy MEH:} Drivers short on cash with broken or no air
          conditioning in their cars would buy a cheap ice cube--powered gizmo to
          help them cool their car.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{XYZ Hypothesis:} At least 5\textpercent{} of people without air
          conditioning will buy a \textdollar{}20 air-cooling gizmo when the average
          temperature gets over 100 degrees.
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:} Beer for dogs
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Fuzzy MEH:} Many dog owners don't like to drink alone; quite a few
          of them would buy a dog-safe beer, so their best friend can drink with
          them.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{XYZ Hypothesis:} At least 15\textpercent{} of dog owners will add
          a six-pack of beer for dogs for \textdollar{}4 when they buy dog food.
        \stopconcept

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        \startconcept{Idea:} {\em Super Squirrel} Collectors' Edition book
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{Fuzzy MEH:} Fans of the {\em Super Squirrel} comic book series will
          go nuts (apologies) for a limited-edition, high-quality collection
          featuring their favorite rodent superhero.
        \stopconcept

        \startconcept{XYZ Hypothesis:} At least 50\textpercent{} of the 220,000
          subscribers to the {\em Super Squirrel} comic will buy the \textdollar{}100
          Collectors' Edition.
        \stopconcept

        These examples may be
        silly (I find that makes them more memorable), but the XYZ Hypothesis is
        a serious and powerful tool; and it becomes even more powerful when we
        combine it with our next thinking tool, hypozooming.

        \section{Hypozooming}

        The goal of {\em hypozooming} is to take a specific but broad hypothesis
        and zoom in until you have a version of that hypothesis that is {\em
        actionable and testable right now}. It's a way to go from XYZ to xyz, a
        smaller, simpler, more immediately verifiable version of your Market
        Engagement Hypothesis. The idea is that if XYZ is true, then xyz must
        also be true---but xyz is much easier to test and verify.

        Let me explain using the XYZ Hypothesis from the pollution sensor
        example:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 10\textpercent{} of people who live in cities with an
          AQI level greater than 100 will buy a \textdollar{}120 portable pollution sensor.}
        \stopnarrow

        This is a well-crafted, say-it-with-numbers Market Engagement
        Hypothesis, but it describes a huge potential market: millions of people
        living in all the polluted cities in the world. As it currently stands,
        this hypothesis is too big a starting point. It's not {\em
        testable}---at least not anytime soon, and definitely not by a handful
        of undergraduate students with midterms looming and no real budget. Time
        to hypozoom.

        \subsection{Target Market Zooming: Y \char"2192{} y}

        The uppercase Y from your Market Engagement Hypothesis represents your
        ultimate target market---all the people in the world
        who you think will
        want to buy your product once it is available. To hypozoom, take that
        huge market and zoom in until you have a small, local, but
        representative subset of it. I want you to go from Y, the entire market,
        to y, a small, manageable, easy-to-reach initial test market. Imagine
        one of those videos where the camera zooms from a view of our planet in
        space down to a continent, then to a country, and then all the way to a
        city or even a specific building. That's exactly what I want you to do
        in your mind's eye with your hypothesis.

        Be aggressive with hypozooming, but make sure that you don't zoom in so
        close that you are left with a sample size too small to be statistically
        significant (\fsp{e.g.}, your two roommates, your mom, and that weird guy
        across the street). So what's a good sample size? Something in the
        neighborhood of 100 to 1,000 people would get a nod of approval from
        most statisticians. But you have to make sure that the population you
        sample is representative of your target market (the type of people who
        might actually buy your product or service).

        For example, 100 randomly chosen people from the 328 million US
        population is a good sample size to test a hypothesis related to a new
        type of pizza, since most people like and can afford pizza. But if you
        are planning to sell a \textdollar{}120,000 all-electric two-seater car (like
        Tesla's original Roadster), you cannot use 100 random people to get your
        data, because most people cannot afford or would not choose such a car.
        In this case, the testing should focus on the target market of, say,
        young, \quotation{geeky} millionaires.

        Let's return to our pollution-monitor example and apply hypozooming to
        it. Many cities have poor air quality. But the students in the team who
        came up with the idea for the portable pollution sensor are from
        Beijing, China, one of the cities with
        the most dangerous
        levels of air pollution in the world. So the first level of zooming for
        them is obvious: zoom from the entire world to Beijing.

        \startnarrow
          {\bf Y: all the cities in the world with an AQI greater than 100}
          \crlf
          {\bf y: Beijing, China}
        \stopnarrow

        That's a good first step, but Beijing is a huge city with a population
        of over 10 million people. They need to zoom in further. After a few
        minutes of discussion, the team determines that parents of young
        children might be an ideal target market. One of the team members
        mentions that his sister's children attend Beijing Tot Academy, a
        private bilingual preschool in Beijing with about 300 students. He
        thinks that his sister would be willing to present the product at the
        next parents' meeting to see how many of the parents would be
        interested. Fantastic. They zoomed in from the entire planet to a
        specific preschool with 300 children:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf Y: all the cities in the world with an AQI greater than 100}
          \crlf
          {\bf y: Beijing Tot Academy parents}
        \stopnarrow

        Since they've zoomed into China, they also change the currency from US
        dollars to Chinese yuan and now have the following xyz hypothesis:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 10\textpercent{} of Beijing Tot Academy parents will buy
          an 800-yuan portable pollution sensor.}
        \stopnarrow

        This is great progress. They now have a say-it-with-numbers hypothesis
        based on a subset of the target market that they can easily reach. But
        they still have a big problem: they don't have the product yet! At this
        point their portable pollution sensor is just an unrealized idea stuck
        in Thoughtland. Designing, developing, and manufacturing such a product
        will take at least one year
        and a lot of money.
        Even a one-off prototype will take a nontrivial investment and months to
        develop. They are stuck in a sort of chicken-and-egg problem. They need
        to validate their Market Engagement Hypothesis to make sure their
        product idea is The Right It before investing a lot of time and money to
        build it. But to validate their MEH they need to have their product
        already built. Or do they?

        The only way to know---with 100 percent certainty---if our idea for a
        new product will be successful in the market is to develop it,
        manufacture it in quantity, run a proper marketing campaign, and see
        what happens. In other words, we go forward on the hope, \quotation{If we build
        it, they will come} (another inspiring line from Hollywood movies that,
        like \quotation{Failure is not an option,} sounds great but usually works against
        you).

        This approach, however, is a very expensive and risky way to find out if
        an idea is The Right It---especially since we know that most ideas will
        fail in the market. But what alternatives do we have? After all, we've
        learned that we can't depend on Thoughtland-based, opinion-driven market
        research---too many false positives and false negatives. We know that we
        need data and not opinions. But we've also learned that we cannot depend
        on OPD; we need to collect YODA. That makes sense, but how can we
        collect YODA until we have built a product to collect it with?

        That's where pretotyping comes in.

        {\em Pretotyping} is a word I made up. Why would I want to do that? The
        best way to explain why we need a new word and why it's relevant to our
        quest for The Right It is by sharing with you the example that led me to
        it.

        \section{The IBM Speech-to-Text Example}

        I first heard this story at a software conference a few years ago. I am
        not sure how accurate my description of the events is and I may get some
        details wrong, but in this case the gist of the story is much more
        important than the details. With that caveat, here's the story as I
        remember hearing it.

        A few decades ago, well before the age of the internet and before the
        dawn of ubiquitous personal computing, IBM was best known for its
        mainframe computers and typewriters. In those days, typing was something
        that only a few people were good at---mostly secretaries, writers, and
        some computer
        programmers. Most
        people typed with one finger, slowly and inefficiently, so companies
        depended on professional typists, who were relatively expensive and
        required things like bathroom breaks and once in a while free bagels and
        coffee to help keep up the morale.

        IBM was ideally positioned to leverage its leading position in the
        computer technology and typewriter market to develop a speech-to-text
        computer. This technology would allow people to speak into a microphone
        and see their words and commands magically appear on the screen with no
        need for typing. By reducing the need for professional typists and
        eventually replacing them, the technology had the potential for making a
        lot of money for IBM---{\em if} the company could make it work and {\em
        if} the intended users were comfortable using it.

        In Thoughtland everyone, with the possible exception of professional
        typists, loved the idea. Many people wanted to use computers, but none
        of them wanted to learn to type. Besides, along with flying cars,
        computers that understood human speech were what most people expected to
        see in the future. But before making what would have been a decades-long
        and very expensive R&D commitment, the company wanted to ensure that its
        target market, businesspeople, would respond positively to this
        technology, not just in Thoughtland but in the real world, after
        experiencing firsthand how it would work and what it could do for them.
        The best way to do that was to expose them to a prototype version of the
        technology. But one major problem stood in the way.

        In those days, computers were much less powerful and considerably more
        expensive than they are today, and a speech-to-text function requires a
        lot of computing power---more than what computers could provide at that
        time. Furthermore, even if adequate processing power were available,
        accurate speech-to-text translation is a very difficult computer science
        problem, which we are
        only now beginning to tackle successfully. In other words, IBM was
        decades away from being able to put together a proper prototype, but it
        needed something in order to validate a key hypothesis about its target
        market. IBM researchers came up with a brilliant solution.

        They set up a mock workstation with a computer box, a monitor, and a
        microphone---but no keyboard. They told several potential customers that
        they had a prototype of a revolutionary speech-to-text computer. They
        then gave the would-be clients some basic usage instructions and invited
        them to try out the new invention. Skeptical but excited, people took
        the microphone and spoke into it: \quotation{Dictate new letter. Dear Mr. Jones,
        In reply to your letter dated~.~.~.} After just a couple of seconds'
        delay, the text of their letter appeared on the monitor.

        All users were impressed. This was too good to be true, which---as it
        turns out---it was.

        \startplacefigure[title={What users thought was going on.}]
          \externalfigure[images/image81.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        What was actually happening, and what makes this such a clever
        experiment, is that no speech-to-text machine existed, not even a
        prototype. The computer box in the room was a dummy.
        In the room next
        door, a skilled typist was listening to the user's voice from the
        microphone and typing the spoken words and commands into a computer
        using a keyboard---the old-fashioned way. Whatever the typist entered on
        the keyboard showed up on the user screen, leading the user to believe
        that what appeared was the output of an actual speech-to-text machine.

        \startplacefigure[title={What was actually going on.}]
          \externalfigure[images/image82.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        IBM learned quite a bit from this experiment. After being initially
        impressed by the \quotation{technology,} most of the people who (in Thoughtland)
        were convinced that they would buy and use a speech-to-text computer
        changed their minds after using the system for a few hours. Even with
        the fast, near-perfect translation simulated by the human typist, using
        speech to enter more than a few lines of text into a computer proved too
        clumsy and problematic in several ways. People's throats would get sore
        after a couple of hours, so much talking created a noisy work
        environment, and it was not suitable for confidential material. Imagine
        dictating a letter saying, \quotation{We need to fire Bob from accounting,} as Bob
        is passing by.

        IBM's approach was
        ingenious, but what would you call it? The speech-to-text setup with the
        typist was not a {\em proper prototype}---not unless one were planning
        to create a breed of miniature typists, stuff them into computer boxes,
        and feed them cheese and crackers through a floppy-drive slot. IBM did
        not have a prototype speech-to-text system; it only {\em pretended} to
        have such a prototype. And it needed to pretend, because if the test
        users knew of, or even suspected, the presence of a person instead of a
        computer at the receiving end of the microphone, they would have acted
        very differently, and the results would have reflected that.

        The first time I heard this story I was left---er---speechless. My first
        thought was: \quotation{Why didn't anyone tell me about this before!?} Like most
        people, I had spent years working on projects and products that turned
        out to be The Wrong It. We had built some prototypes first, of course,
        but the primary goal of those prototypes was to see if and how we could
        build the product; we were working on the assumption \quotation{If we build it,
        they will come.} We often spent months and millions just on those
        prototypes. And once you've invested that much time and money to develop
        something, it becomes really painful to call it quits---even when the
        actual market response is negative. So you tend to keep going, adding
        new features and making tweaks, hoping that somehow the situation will
        turn around. It's an expensive and dangerous spiral.

        \section{Pretotyping}

        As an engineer, when I think of a prototype for a new technology I
        imagine a clumsy, hacked-together, wires-sticking-out,
        not-ready-for-prime-time version of that technology. What
        IBM did, however,
        struck me as something different enough from our common notion of a
        prototype to deserve its own word. The first word I came up with was
        {\em pretendotyping}. I thought it was an appropriate term because the
        IBM team, years away from being able to put together a proper prototype,
        {\em pretended} to have one.

        But, although evocative, {\em pretendotyping} proved awkward to say or
        write, so I simplified it to {\em pretotyping}. The word worked well for
        me because the prefix {\em pre-} suggests something that comes before
        something else. In this case, pretotyping comes before prototyping, and
        the noun {\em pretotype} describes an artifact that precedes a
        prototype. So {\em pretotyping} combines the critical elements of both
        \quotation{comes before} and \quotation{pretending.}

        Over the years, I've learned (primarily through hostile tweets and
        snarky comments on various social-media platforms) that a few people
        really dislike the word {\em pretotype.} They think that the word {\em
        prototype} already covers all the bases, so there's no need to craft a
        new word. I agree with their premise, but disagree with their
        conclusion. {\em Prototype does} cover all the bases---but that's
        exactly the problem! The term is too generic; it can mean anything. As
        it's currently used, a prototype can refer to anything from a 5\textcent{}
        paper-clips-and-rubber-band contraption to a \textdollar{}5 million one-off working
        version of an idea. I've seen the term {\em prototype} used to describe
        five-minute experiments as well as five-year projects involving hundreds
        of people.

        Furthermore, prototypes and pretotypes serve different functions.
        Prototypes are primarily designed to test if an idea for a product or
        service can be built, how it should be built, how (and if) it will work,
        what's the best size or shape for it, and so on. Pretotypes, on the
        other hand, are designed primarily to validate, quickly and cheaply, if
        an idea is worth pursuing and
        building in the first
        place---a different objective that is best accomplished with a different
        set of techniques and best served by having its own vocabulary. In fact,
        in the rest of the book, I will not only use the word {\em pretotype},
        but assign unique names to the different types of pretotypes. Is all
        this new nomenclature necessary? I believe so. Let's see if I can get
        you to agree with me.

        Is it necessary to have names for different types of insects? A bug is a
        bug after all.

        In our pantry we have boxes of spaghetti, spaghettini, linguine,
        fettuccine, bucatini, ditalini, and tortellini. What's the difference?
        Pasta is pasta. Someone should tell those pasta companies to stop
        confusing us with all those varieties.

        What about karate, judo, jujitsu, kung fu, aikido, and tae kwon do. How
        many exotic ways can there be to kick someone's butt?

        And do we really need all those names for the countless ways we can fall
        ill? Do you really need to differentiate a cold from the flu? One type
        of infection from another? A stomachache from appendicitis? Food
        poisoning from radiation poisoning? One prescription pill from another?
        After all, sick is sick, and medicine is medicine. I will stop here, but
        you can see where I am going.

        In many fields, including ours, the right words help us to work and
        communicate more efficiently and with greater precision. More important,
        the right terminology sets the proper expectations and influences how we
        approach a situation. I would prepare for and approach crossing a river
        very differently than I would a creek---even though, technically, a
        river and a creek are both flowing bodies of water. Similarly, a
        six-month schedule and \textdollar{}300,000 budget would not be out of the norm for
        a prototype, but it would be totally out of line for a pretotype
        because, as we shall
        see, the word {\em pretotype} implies schedules that are measured by
        hours (or days at the most) and budgets that rarely go above a few
        hundred dollars.

        If you are still unconvinced about the need for new terminology, I hope
        you will not let that stop you from reading on and applying the tools
        and tactics I am about to introduce. I'd hate to lose you over a minor
        lexical matter. Feel free to replace {\em pretotype} with {\em
        prototype}, if you must. But please keep an open mind, because I am
        confident that, if you give it a chance, you will see that benefits of
        our more precise terminology are well worth the minor cost.

        \sectionbreak

        In 2009, while I was at Google, I started explaining the terms {\em
        pretotyping} and {\em pretotype} to my colleagues in engineering and
        product management. Much to my surprise, almost all of them found the
        approach not only interesting, but applicable to most projects and
        potentially very useful in preventing investment in The Wrong It. In
        fact, many of them, after hearing the IBM speech-to-text example, said
        something along the lines of: \quotation{I wish we had done something similar with
        our last failed project. It would have saved us a ton of time, money,
        and embarrassment.}

        That's when I decided to see if I could uncover other examples of
        pretotyping.

        \section{In Search of Pretotypes}

        It's a well-known phenomenon that when your mind is focused on
        something, you begin to see instances of that thing all around you. For
        example, if you are thinking of buying a Volkswagen
        convertible, you
        start seeing VW convertibles all over the road. Something similar
        happened to me with pretotyping. After hearing the IBM speech-to-text
        story and coming up with the term {\em pretotyping}, I started to notice
        and collect anecdotes and examples of techniques that, like the IBM
        example, could qualify as pretotyping.

        I also started researching and collecting instances of ideas for new
        products that had failed in the market despite all kinds of optimistic
        predictions. I eliminated from that set all the failures that could be
        attributed to poor execution of the idea, so what I had left was a list
        of {\em well-executed failures}. These were ideas that FLOPped in the
        market not due to incompetent execution in Launch or Operations, but
        because the very Premise of the idea was off---the idea was The Wrong
        It. This is not only the most common failure scenario, but also the most
        costly and painful one: we work hard to build It right, only to discover
        that we have built The Wrong It. Ouch.

        This list of painful failures included my own, those of my friends and
        colleagues, and many that were reported in business articles and the
        news. (One of the good things about researching market failures is that
        there is never a shortage of examples.) After a few weeks of being on
        the lookout for examples of pretotypes and market failures, I had
        collected a short list of pretotyping techniques and a long list of The
        Wrong It failures. And that's when things got really interesting.

        I took each of those failures and asked: Could this market failure have
        been prevented by one or more pretotyping techniques? To put it another
        way, could we have learned, before getting in too deep, that the premise
        for this product was wrong (the product was The Wrong It), using some
        creative pretotyping techniques?

        In almost every case
        the answer was a clear and resounding yes! Most of those painful and
        costly failures could have been easily prevented with well-planned and
        -executed pretotyping experiments. No approach or set of tools can give
        you a 100 percent guarantee, but if properly used, pretotyping tools
        will help you determine if an idea is The Right It or The Wrong It
        faster and more reliably than any market-research approach based in
        Thoughtland.

        If you think that this sounds too good to be true, I don't blame you.
        That was my initial reaction. I am a skeptic by nature; but after
        several years of using, coaching, and teaching these tools and
        techniques, I am convinced that they work. But don't take my word for
        it. After all, I am biased, and my experience is at best OPD and at
        worst anecdotal---two types of data I've warned you not to depend upon.
        So I say, \quotation{Don't trust me. Test me!} The best way to convince yourself
        of the logic and power of pretotyping is to experience it firsthand. Go
        get Your Own DAta.

        In the following pages I will introduce you to pretotyping techniques
        that, alone or in combination, can be applied to collect valuable YODA
        to help you validate any new product idea. If you've ever worked on a
        new product that failed in the market because it was not The Right It,
        you will probably discover one or more techniques that might have
        prevented that failure.

        \section{The Mechanical Turk Pretotype}

        The Mechanical Turk pretotype borrows its name from the famous
        Mechanical Turk chess-playing \quotation{machine} that toured the world in the
        late eighteenth century. People were led to believe that the \quotation{Turk} was
        a mechanical contraption (an automaton) programmed
        to play chess. In
        reality, however, the box concealed a small expert chess player making
        the moves by manipulating the mannequin.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image89.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        A Mechanical Turk pretotype is ideal for situations where you can
        replace costly, complex, or yet-to-be-developed technology with a
        concealed human being performing the functions of that supposedly
        advanced technology.

        Sound familiar? It should. The IBM speech-to-text experiment with which
        I started this chapter is a great example of a Mechanical Turk pretotype
        in action. Developing a good enough speech-to-text engine would have
        taken years and a huge investment. But a human typist, hidden in another
        room the same way the chess player was hidden inside the Mechanical Turk
        device, easily simulated that complex function and allowed IBM to
        collect the YODA it needed.

        Let's look at another example where a Mechanical Turk pretotype can help
        us validate our idea.

        \subsection{Example: Fold4U}

        Most coin laundries have machines to wash clothes and machines to dry
        them. But at the end of the drying cycle, we have to first sort out a
        jumbled pile of assorted garments and then fold and stack them by hand.
        We have self-driving cars, but we still have to fold clothes manually?
        That's unacceptable! Okay, perhaps that's a bit of an exaggeration, but
        wouldn't it be great if
        there were a
        clothes-folding and -stacking machine to take care of that last step?

        Ivan the inventor believes that he can build such a machine, and he's
        convinced that, by leasing it to coin laundries for a fixed monthly
        price plus a per-use fee, he can turn piles of clothes into piles of
        cash. All he needs is \textdollar{}50,000 and about six months to build a
        proof-of-concept prototype. Ivan does not have the money, because the
        invention from his previous venture---the RoboDogWalker---did not sell
        as well as he had anticipated. So he offers Angela, a friend who also
        happens to be an angel investor, a 25\textpercent{} equity stake in
        his new company, Fold4U, in exchange for the \textdollar{}50,000.

        Angela has full confidence in Ivan's technical prowess. She knows that
        if Ivan says that he can build an automatic clothes folder and stacker,
        he will. But she is not at all confident in Ivan's business model and
        financial projections for Fold4U. Ivan's plan is based on the premise
        that most coin laundry customers would be willing to pay an extra \textdollar{}2 to
        \textdollar{}3 to have their clothes folded and stacked.

        When Angela calls Ivan's Market Engagement Hypothesis into question,
        Ivan gets defensive: \quotation{It's not an assumption, Angie. I've done my market
        research. I've interviewed 632 coin laundry users while they were
        folding their clothes. And 421 of them told me that they hated doing it
        and would gladly pay a few extra dollars if there were a machine that
        could do that for them.}

        \quotation{Isn't that the same kind of survey you did for RoboDogWalker?} Angela
        asks.

        Ivan's face turns beet red. He responds, \quotation{Look Angie, if you are not
        interested in investing in Fold4U, just tell me. There's no need to
        humiliate me. I know that RoboDogWalker was a
        failure, and the
        unfortunate accident with the poodle didn't help. But this is a much
        better---and less risky---idea and a completely different market.}

        \quotation{Ivan, I {\em am} interested,} replies Angela. \quotation{Quite interested, in
        fact. I can definitely see the potential for Fold4U. But before I invest
        \textdollar{}50,000 to build a prototype, I need stronger evidence that all those
        coin laundry customers who {\em say} they'd pay for the service will
        {\em actually} pay for it. I want to see those people put their clothes
        in the machine and pay for it.}

        \quotation{That's why I need the money to build the prototype, Angie. How can we
        test that people would pay for the Fold4U if we don't have one
        available?}

        Before you read on, spend a couple of minutes thinking how you would
        reply to Ivan if you were in Angela's shoes. Would you give Ivan the
        \textdollar{}50,000? How could you use a Mechanical Turk pretotype to validate
        Ivan's MEH? C'mon, give it a shot. It's simple, and I am confident
        you'll get it right.

        \sectionbreak

        All right. I hope you tried the exercise. If you did, compare your
        answer to what Angela and Ivan came up with.

        Angela shares with Ivan the IBM speech-to-text story. By the time she is
        done, Ivan's face is still red, but for a different reason. His
        irritation has changed into excitement. \quotation{That was so clever of those IBM
        folks. I can't believe I never heard this story before. I think we can
        use this {\em prontotyping} thing to test Fold4U.}

        \quotation{It's called {\em pretotyping,}} says Angela with a laugh, \quotation{but
        considering how quickly it gets you results, prontotyping would also be
        a good name.}

        After some discussion, Ivan and Angela come up with the XYZ Hypothesis:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least
          50\textpercent{} of coin laundry customers will pay \textdollar{}2 to \textdollar{}4
          (depending on location) per load to have their clothes folded and
          stacked.}
        \stopnarrow

        Then they hypozoom into and decide to test the following xyz hypothesis:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 50\textpercent{} of Lenny's coin laundry customers will
          put their clothes in a Fold4U machine and pay \textdollar{}2 to have them folded.}
        \stopnarrow

        And now the fun starts. Ivan meets with Lenny (a local coin laundry
        owner), explains to him the Fold4U idea, and offers him \textdollar{}200 to let him
        run a pretotyping experiment in his shop. Lenny agrees to the deal, and
        since he's just as excited and interested in the idea as Ivan, he also
        agrees to help Ivan set up and run the experiment. He even gives Ivan an
        old broken clothes dryer---a perfect prop for the experiment.

        Ivan modifies the old dryer by replacing the drum with a compartment
        that has a hidden door in the back. This way, after people put their
        clothes in the machine and pay, Ivan can open the hidden back door, pull
        out the clothes, fold them by hand, and put them back. To complete the
        illusion, Ivan makes a recording of mechanical noises that he has
        playing inside the machine while he manually folds the clothes. At the
        end of the \quotation{fold cycle,} he rings a little brass bell from inside the
        machine to alert the customer that the clothes are done.

        The pretotype works so well that none of the users suspect a thing. They
        all believe their clothes are being folded by some kind of robot. But
        although most of Lenny's coin laundry customers are intrigued by the new
        machine, few choose to use it. And most of those who do admit to doing
        so out of curiosity. The initial pretotyping experiment falls well short
        of expectations:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf xyz hypothesis:
          At least 50\textpercent{} of Lenny's coin laundry customers will put
          their clothes in a Fold4U machine and pay \textdollar{}2 to have them folded.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\bf YODA: 12\textpercent{} of Lenny's coin laundry customers paid \textdollar{}2
          to have their clothes folded by a Fold4U.}
        \stopnarrow

        Just to make sure, over a period of two weeks, Ivan runs a few more
        experiments using different prices and different coin laundries.
        Unfortunately, the results don't change much---even when the price is
        dropped to just \textdollar{}1. In Thoughtland, people said (and probably believed)
        that they would pay \textdollar{}2 to \textdollar{}4 for such a service, but when the time
        came to actually put some skin in the game (in the form of coins in the
        clothes folder), very few did.

        Does this mean that there is no chance for Fold4U? Not necessarily. But
        Ivan's plan and business model was based on 50\textpercent{} or more
        of coin laundry users paying for the machine; if the actual number is
        less than 15\textpercent{}, he will have to revise many of his
        assumptions if he hopes to convince investors like Angela to back him.

        Ivan may be disappointed that Fold4U is unlikely to be The Right It, but
        he's also relieved that, unlike RoboDogWalker, he did not waste two
        years of his life as well as a big chunk of money to learn that lesson.

        What do you say, Ivan?

        \quotation{Thank you, pretotyping!}

        \sectionbreak

        Did I hear some of you say that, after all this talk about failure, you
        would like a happy ending once in a while? Well, I might argue that
        preventing Ivan from another business disaster like the RoboDogWalker
        {\em is} a happy ending, but I know what you mean;
        you want a proper,
        Hollywood-like happy ending. No problem. You deserve it. Here you go.

        {\em Alternative Ending}: Not only are most of Lenny's coin laundry
        customers intrigued by the new machine, they are lining up to use it. In
        fact, the new Fold4U is quite the sensation. People applaud every new
        batch of folded clothes that comes out. Everybody wants to see and use
        the new machine. But, of course, it's not a machine doing the folding,
        but poor Ivan. The next day, just as his arms were ready to fall off
        from all that folding, Ivan ends the experiment. He puts an \quotation{Out of
        Order} sign on the pretotype and goes to meet Angela. This time, instead
        of Thoughtland surveys, he presents her with fresh YODA:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf xyz hypothesis: At least 50\textpercent{} of Lenny's coin laundry
          customers will put their clothes in a Fold4U machine and pay \textdollar{}2 to have
          them folded.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\bf YODA: 78\textpercent{} of Lenny's coin laundry customers paid \textdollar{}2
          to have their clothes folded by a Fold4U.}
        \stopnarrow

        Angela is thrilled. To make sure the great results aren't a fluke, she
        and Ivan agree to hire part-time assistants to help with the folding and
        to run additional experiments. As the novelty wears off, market
        engagement drops a little (it turns out that some people were more
        curious to see if and how the machine worked than in using it
        regularly). But the average market engagement (the number of coin
        laundry patrons who pay to have their clothes folded by the Fold4U after
        drying them) stays at a healthy 62\textpercent{}---providing strong
        confirmation for Ivan's 50\textpercent{} or more projection in the XYZ
        Hypothesis.

        People said that they would pay for such a service, and when the time
        came to actually put some skin in the game, they did. In this case, YODA
        matched opinions. It happens. Just not as
        often as we'd like,
        and that's why we need to test the ideas.

        Angela decides to invest in Fold4U, and by using the impressive YODA
        from the pretotype, Ivan is able to increase his company valuation and
        recruit additional investors. Not only that, but when the time comes to
        market and sell the Fold4U, Ivan can provide coin laundry owners with a
        compelling business case: \quotation{Our data shows that over 60\textpercent{}
        of your customers will pay an extra \textdollar{}2 to \textdollar{}4 per load to have their
        clothes folded. This will increase your total revenue and profits by at
        least 20\textpercent{}.} Sold!

        What do you say, Ivan?

        \quotation{Thank you, pretotyping!}

        \sectionbreak

        As these two different endings show, investing a little time and
        resources to pretotype an idea is a win-win tactic:

        \startnarrow
          If YODA from the experiments does not validate your hypotheses,
          pretotyping will save you from a very likely failure.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          If YODA confirms your hypotheses, you will be in a better position to
          recruit partners, secure investors, and convince potential customers.
        \stopnarrow

        Every idea deserves to be pretotyped, and there's (at least) a pretotype
        for every idea---so let's give the Mechanical Turk (and Ivan's arms) a
        well-deserved rest, and let's explore a few more pretotyping techniques.

        \section{The Pinocchio Pretotype}

        The Pinocchio pretotype is named after the beloved fictional character
        Pinocchio, the wooden puppet who dreamed of becoming a real boy. You
        will understand why I picked this name after I share with you the
        example that inspired it.

        \subsection{Example: The PalmPilot}

        In the mid-1990s, brilliant innovator and entrepreneur Jeff Hawkins had
        an idea for the personal digital assistant (PDA) that would eventually
        become the PalmPilot. But before committing to it and investing in
        building an expensive prototype, which would have required a full team
        of engineers and a lot of time and money, he wanted to validate some of
        his assumptions about the device. He {\em knew} he could build it, but
        would he use it? What would he use it for? And how often would he use
        it?

        His solution was to carve a block of wood to match the intended size of
        the device, whittle down a chopstick to make a stylus, and use paper
        sleeves to simulate various user screens and functions. He carried the
        block of wood in his pocket for several
        weeks and pretended
        that it was a functional device in order to get insights into how he
        would use it. If someone asked for a meeting, for example, he'd pull out
        his wooden block and tap on it to simulate checking his calendar and
        scheduling a meeting reminder.

        \startplacefigure[title={The PalmPilot wooden model on display at the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, CA.}]
          \externalfigure[images/image96.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        With the help of his pretotype, Hawkins collected valuable YODA. He
        learned that he would actually carry such a device with him and that he
        would be using it mostly for four functions: address book, calendar,
        memo, and to-do lists. His simple experiment provided him with enough
        YODA to convince him that he would love to have a working version of the
        device. He knew, of course, that a sample size of one (himself) was not
        sufficient to determine if other people would respond to the Pilot the
        same way he did. He would have to follow up this test with additional
        experiments to validate the rest of the market. But the idea passed an
        important first test: its own inventor found it useful. This may seem a
        trivial threshold to pass, but you'd be surprised how many people bring
        to market a product without first validating that they themselves would
        use it.

        The data collected from the simple wood and paper pretotype helped to
        guide and justify the much greater investment needed to develop a proper
        working prototype. Not only did the PalmPilot become incredibly
        successful, it also paved the way for smartphones and established a form
        factor (\fsp{i.e.}, shape and size) for most portable electronic devices that
        continues to this day. Pinocchio was a wooden puppet who dreamed of
        becoming a real boy. The PalmPilot pretotype was a wooden PDA that Jeff
        Hawkins dreamed might one day become a real product. Both dreams came
        true.

        In addition to being a great example of a powerful pretotyping
        technique, the PalmPilot story also illustrates some of the
        key concepts I've
        been emphasizing. Below is how {\em TIME} magazine reported it in March
        1998. I've marked some of the key points in italic:

        \startnarrow
          Hawkins, 40, Palm's chief technologist and Pilot's creator, designed one
          of the first handheld computers, the GRiDPad, a decade ago. It was {\em
          an engineering marvel but a market failure} because, he says, it was
          still too big. Determined {\em not to make the same mistake twice}, he
          had a ready answer when his colleagues asked him how small their new
          device should be: \quotation{Let's try the shirt pocket.}

          Retreating to his garage, he cut a block of wood to fit in his shirt
          pocket. Then he carried it around for months, {\em pretending} it was a
          computer. Was he free for lunch on Wednesday? Hawkins would haul out the
          block and tap on it {\em as if} he were checking his schedule. If he
          needed a phone number, he would {\em pretend} to look it up on the wood.
          Occasionally he would try out different design faces with various button
          configurations, using paper printouts glued to the
          block.\footnote{David S. Jackson,
          \quotation{Palm-to-Palm Combat,} {\em TIME}, March 16, 1998.}
        \stopnarrow

        This story embodies the core motivations for and principles of
        pretotyping:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Hawkins's painful experience of spending years and millions to produce
            the GRiDPad, a product that turned out to be \quotation{an engineering marvel
            but a market failure.}
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            His realization that the mistake was not that he built It wrong, but
            that he had built The Wrong It.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A commitment \quotation{not
            to make the same mistake twice.} In other words, he told himself
            something along the lines of, \quotation{Next time, make sure that you are
            building The Right It before you build It right.}
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            The creation of a first pretotype---not to test if the Pilot could be
            built, but to test if, how, and how much one would actually use it, by
            collecting firsthand YODA to inform design decisions for the actual
            prototype and eventual product. For example:

            \startitemize
              \startitem
                Carried the device in my pocket 95\textpercent{} of the time.
              \stopitem
              \startitem
                Pulled it out to use it an average of 12 times a day.
              \stopitem
            \stopitemize

            For scheduling appointments: 55\textpercent{} of the time

            To look up phone numbers or addresses: 25\textpercent{} of the time

            To add to or check a to-do list: 15\textpercent{} of the time

            To take notes: 5\textpercent{} of the time
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Using his imagination (\fsp{i.e.}, pretending) to fill in the missing
            functionality using a dummy of the envisioned product as a prop.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        \startplacefigure[title={The PalmPilot pretotype next to the product.}]
          \externalfigure[images/image99.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        Mock-ups and
        nonfunctional prototypes are quite common in innovation, but the act of
        pretending that the mock-ups are functional and using them as such
        (especially for an extended period of time, as Jeff Hawkins did) is
        rare. Remember, {\em pretending} is an important part of pretotyping.

        \subsection{You Say {\em Proto}, I Say {\em Preto}}

        The PalmPilot story illustrates one of the key differences between
        pretotyping and prototyping that we previously discussed. The picture
        below is an example of what any red-blooded engineer has in mind when
        the word {\em prototype} is mentioned:

        \startplacefigure[title={A PalmPilot working prototype on display at the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, CA.}]
          \externalfigure[images/image100.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        As one of those red-blooded engineers myself, I love building
        prototypes. I can't wait to fire up my oscilloscope and my soldering
        iron. But I've learned to wait before investing a lot of time building a
        working prototype.

        Remember that the
        primary purpose of {\em prototypes} is to answer such questions as:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Can we build it?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Will it work as intended?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How small/big/cheap/energy-efficient can we make it?
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        These are important questions. But experience and a ton of evidence tell
        us that most of the time we can build it, we can make it work as
        intended, and eventually we'll be able to optimize size, energy
        efficiency, and so on. In other words, we should be confident in our
        ability to build it and make it work as intended.

        The primary purpose of {\em pretotypes}, on the other hand, is to answer
        such questions as:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Would I use it?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How, how often, and when would I use it?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Would other people buy it?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How much would they be willing to pay for it?
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How, how often, and when would they use it?
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        The answers to these questions will help us answer the most critical
        question of all: Should we build it?

        With that out of the way, here are two more examples of the Pinocchio
        pretotype in action.

        \subsection{Example: Smart Horn}

        Your car horn is a blunt tool for communicating with other drivers. If
        you are like most people, you use your horn for several
        different purposes
        while on the road. A {\em hooonk!} can mean any of the following:

        \startnarrow
          \quotation{Move your butt!} to a driver who takes more than a millisecond to start
          moving after the light turns green.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          \quotation{Thank you,} to a driver who lets you pass on a two-lane road.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          \quotation{Hi, Bob,} to your friend Bob driving by.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          \quotation{You got a death wish, you moron?} to a pedestrian who runs in front of
          you.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          And the all-purpose \quotation{You \texthash{}\textdollar{}\textpercent{}^&*!}
        \stopnarrow

        Enter the Smart Horn, a four-button horn that can accompany each honk
        with a programmable message---so you don't have to stick your head out
        the car window to yell it. For example, you can program it with the
        following: \quotation{Move it,} \quotation{Thank you,} \quotation{Hi there,} \quotation{Watch it,} and \quotation{You
        @\texthash{}\textdollar{}\textpercent{}^&*!}

        There's no question that such a horn {\em can} be built. But would
        people use it, how would they use it, and how often? You can do what
        Jeff Hawkins did and begin by pretotyping it for yourself---to see if
        {\em you} would use it. The simplest way to do that is to put four
        stickers, each one with a different label representing a different horn
        sound, on your steering wheel and then drive around for a couple of
        weeks pretending that those stickers are working buttons for the Smart
        Horn. You might discover that, as tempting as it sounds, having your car
        yell \quotation{You @\texthash{}\textdollar{}\textpercent{}^&*!} to a group of leather-clad
        motorcyclists would not be such a good idea.

        If you are mechanically or electronically adept, you can easily upgrade
        from stickers to buttons that count how many times you've pressed them,
        which will make your data collection more
        precise. With some
        persuasion, you might also convince your family and friends to pretend
        along with you. Ask them what messages they'd like on their Smart Horn,
        put stickers on their steering wheels, and ask them to keep track of how
        often they actually use them.

        \subsection{Example: Smart Speaker, or Voice-Controlled Assistant}

        At the time I am writing this, smart speakers like the Amazon Echo,
        Google Home, and Apple HomePod are a hot and competitive new tech
        category. I could not have predicted how successful smart speakers would
        be in the market, but after I heard that such devices were in the works,
        I predicted---with confidence---that {\em I} would buy and use at least
        three of them a couple of years before the first one was launched. I
        made this prediction using the Pinocchio pretotype.

        I took a can of pinto beans and put some black masking tape over it to
        make it look high-tech. I named my Pinocchio pretotype \quotation{HAL} (after the
        HAL 9000 computer in {\em 2001: A Space Odyssey}), set it on my
        living-room coffee table, and began pretending that HAL was functional.
        I would say to it:

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{HAL, what will the weather be like today?}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{HAL, remind me to call my mom in one hour.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{HAL, play some Led Zeppelin.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{HAL, wake me up at 5 \fsp{a.m.} tomorrow.}}
        \stopnarrow

        Of course, the can of beans did not respond to my commands. I would have
        checked into a mental institution if it had. But the simple act of
        pretending that it could have carried out my requests provided me with
        valuable YODA and insights on where, how, and how often I would use such
        a device. I learned, for example,
        that I would want at
        least three such devices: one for the living room, one for the bedroom,
        and one for my study. After a few days of interacting with my pretotype,
        I discovered that, in addition to a volume knob, I wanted it to have a
        \quotation{Stop Listening} button---just in case those pinto beans were listening
        to my private conversations. I also determined that, ideally, the
        microphones should either be sensitive enough to register a soft command
        or have a \quotation{whisper mode,} so I would not wake up the entire household at
        5 \fsp{a.m.} by yelling, \quotation{HAL, is it going to rain this morning?}

        \stopplacefigure

        Within a week of pretending, I was convinced that such a device would
        definitely be The Right It for me and that it had a very good chance of
        being The Right It for millions of people, and thus a market success.
        When Amazon announced the Echo in 2015, I was one of the first people in
        line to buy one, then a second, and then a third. Not only that, but
        when I first saw a photo of the Echo, I just had to smile at how closely
        it resembled my can-of-pinto-beans pretotype.

        \section{The Fake Door Pretotype}

        The name for the Fake Door pretotype comes to us courtesy of Jess Lee,
        who at the time was CEO and cofounder of community-based shopping site
        Polyvore. Thanks, Jess!

        The basic concept
        behind the Fake Door pretotype is that you can get some data on how many
        people would be interested in your idea by putting up a {\em front door}
        (\fsp{e.g.}, an ad, a website, a brochure, a physical storefront) to help you
        pretend that the product or service exists when, in fact, you have
        nothing to offer quite yet. If you can't get enough people to {\em
        knock} on your product's front door (\fsp{i.e.}, to show interest in your
        idea), then you go back to the drawing board and review your ideas and
        your hypotheses.

        Early in his legendary and influential career, Kevin Kelly, bestselling
        author and founder of {\em Wired} magazine, used this approach to test
        the market for his first business idea, a catalog of budget travel
        guides. This is how Kelly describes it in Tim Ferriss's book {\em Tribe
        of Mentors}:

        \startnarrow
          I started my first business with \textdollar{}200. I bought an ad in the back of
          {\em Rolling Stone} magazine advertising a catalog of budget travel
          guides for \textdollar{}1. Neither the catalog nor the book inventory existed. If I
          hadn't gotten enough orders, I would have returned the money {[}from any
          order{]}, but it all worked out by
          bootstrapping.\footnote{Tim Ferriss, {\em
          Tribe of Mentors: Short Life Advice from the Best in the World} (New
          York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2017), p. 249.}
        \stopnarrow

        Ads in the back of magazines seem so quaint these days, but this
        happened in the early 1980s when those relatively cheap ads were one of
        the few ways a small-time entrepreneur could reach a target audience.

        Around the time Kevin Kelly was experimenting with the market for travel
        guides, I was busy finishing college and learning computer programming.
        When the IBM PC was launched in 1981, I saw a unique opportunity for
        putting my newly acquired
        programming skills
        to good use by writing video games, which were becoming very popular in
        those days. With a \textdollar{}5,000 investment from my father (Thanks,
        Dad!),\footnote{That figure, \textdollar{}5,000,
        was a significant amount of money for our family in those days---about
        six months' rent. And when you consider that at the time I had very
        limited programming experience and zero business experience, it was a
        foolish thing to do. Worrying about paying my dad back kept me up at
        night, and I think he worried a lot about it too. Fortunately it all
        worked out in the end.} I bought one
        of the first IBM PCs ever produced and launched my first business: a
        one-man video-games company.

        I named it Heigen Corporation, because I thought that sounded big and
        impressive. Some of my games, especially {\em Ramsak}, a primitive
        PacMan-like game, were successful. But other titles, like {\em BitBat}
        or {\em XO-Fighter}, produced disappointing sales. Unfortunately, unlike
        Kevin Kelly, I did not have the foresight to invest a few hundred
        dollars to test the market interest for each game before investing two
        to three months in developing it. I did not realize it at the time, but
        that was my first exposure to the Law of Market Failure and the
        importance of making sure that you are building The Right It before you
        build It right. Had I known about the Fake Door pretotyping technique, I
        would have done things differently.

        Before developing a full game with multiple levels, I would have created
        some static screenshots and brief descriptions for several possible
        games. Then I would use those screenshots to compose and publish \quotation{coming
        soon} ads for each of them. The ads would encourage people to mail us a
        letter with a self-addressed stamped envelope (email did not exist then)
        to receive a \textdollar{}5 discount coupon and to be notified when the game was
        available. Let's say, for example, that I was considering four new ideas
        for my next game:

        \startnarrow
          {\em Lost in
          Bitland}: A maze adventure with puzzles.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em Digi Kong}: Stealing bananas from a giant monkey.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em Pixel Racer}: A racing game.
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em Tapeworm}: I'll skip the description for this one.
        \stopnarrow

        I would create and publish similar ads for each game and, a few weeks
        later (that's how long it took in the pre-internet days), I would be
        able to compare the results:

        \startplacetable

              \stopxrow
            \stopxtablebody
          \stopxtable
        \stopplacetable

        I was rooting for {\em Tapeworm}, but \quotation{data beats opinions.} I would get
        busy working on {\em Pixel Racer} first, put {\em Lost in Bitland} next
        in the queue---and scrap plans for {\em Digi Kong} and, alas, for {\em
        Tapeworm}. At the same time, I would publish additional ads for {\em
        Pixel Racer} in several other magazines, since I had data that those ads
        would generate a strong response and be worth the investment.

        Two or three months later (I was a fast programmer in those days) the
        people who were interested in {\em Pixel Racer} and {\em Lost in
        Bitland} would receive a letter with the promised \textdollar{}5 discount coupon,
        announcing that the {\em Pixel Racer} game was available for purchase
        now and that {\em Lost in Bitland} would be released in a few months.
        What about the people who were interested in the two other games? I
        would send them a letter explaining that, regretfully, we decided not to
        publish {\em Digi Kong} and {\em Tapeworm}, and as a form of atonement I
        would include a free copy of {\em Pixel Racer}.

        I can imagine many
        of you cringing a bit at the trickery involved with this technique.
        Good. It means that you have a working ethical compass. I also cringe a
        bit every time I present it. The Fake Door pretotype is both my most
        favorite and least favorite technique: most favorite, because it's so
        darn efficient and effective; least favorite, because it contains an
        element of deception. Because of that deception, one should not use this
        strategy with certain product categories (\fsp{e.g.}, medical devices or
        services), and use it with extreme awareness and consideration of
        ethical issues with {\em all} types of products and services.

        I also recommend being generous with the people who knock on the door.
        Give the people who give you YODA something valuable in return for their
        trouble---this way you get a win-win-win situation, as I did in this
        example. Think about it:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            The people who were interested in {\em Pixel Racer} and {\em Lost in
            Bitland} win, because they are going to get the games they
            wanted---and a \textdollar{}5 discount on top of that.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            The people who were interested in {\em Digi Kong} and {\em Tapeworm}
            are not going to get those games. But they still win, because I am
            sending them a free copy of one of my other games. I suspect that, for
            most of them, the surprise of receiving a new game (a \textdollar{}29.95 value)
            for free will more than make up for not being able to pay to play a
            game called {\em Tapeworm}.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            I win by not wasting my time and money creating and advertising games
            that not enough people are interested in.
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        Fun fact: I am not much into playing computer games, but I really
        enjoyed designing and developing them. Once I graduated from college,
        however, I got out of the computer-game business even though my games
        were selling well. Why? Because my dad (and investor) said, \quotation{Computer
        games are just a fad. If we stick
        to them, we will
        never be a big business. The next program you write should be some kind
        of business application.}

        I could have developed {\em Super Mario}, but instead I developed {\em
        Supermailer}, a mailing-list manager. Ever heard of it? Thought so.
        Contrary to my father's opinion, today the video-game business is bigger
        than either the movie or the music business, with several game companies
        worth billions of dollars. They say \quotation{Father knows best.} Perhaps. But
        not when it comes to predicting market success.

        Let's walk through a couple more examples of Fake Door pretotypes in
        action, beginning with a brick-and-mortar example.

        \subsection{Example: Antonia's Antique Bookstore}

        Imagine that, on a bleak December day, you are wandering weak and weary
        on a busy downtown street, when you walk by a door with a sign that
        announces the opening of a new antique bookstore.

        As a book lover, you can hardly contain your delight. With visions of
        volumes of forgotten lore---perhaps a first edition from one of your
        favorite authors, Edgar Allan Poe---you gently rap on the door: {\em
        knock-knock}.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image109.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        No answer. You knock again. Still no answer. You knock a third time.
        Nothing. No telltale sign of anyone behind that door. \quotation{The owner must be
        napping or perhaps can't hear my tapping,} you say to yourself and, a
        bit disappointed, you walk away.

        Without realizing
        it, you've just taken part in a Fake Door pretotype and provided Antonia
        with a valuable morsel of YODA.

        You see, Antonia is seriously thinking of quitting her job as a book
        editor and opening an antique bookstore in that neighborhood, but at
        this time there isn't a single book for sale behind that door---let
        alone a full bookstore. In fact, there's nothing behind that door but a
        vacant piece of real estate. Antonia doesn't have a lot of money to
        spend on traditional market research for her bookstore, but her Market
        Engagement Hypothesis is that if she opens the store on the right street
        and advertises it with a big sign, a lot of people will discover it as
        they walk by, and after that word-of-mouth marketing will do the rest.

        For this plan to work, she determines that she needs at least
        0.5\textpercent{} of people (1 in 200) who pass by each day to show
        enough interest to visit the store at least once. Before investing some
        serious capital to lease a space, buy inventory, hire staff, and so on,
        she wants to validate that hypothesis. So she invests \textdollar{}20 to make a
        sign, \textdollar{}2 on double-sided tape, and a few hours of her time testing the
        sign at various streets and locations that she believes will have the
        right kind of pedestrian traffic (\fsp{i.e.}, a decent percentage of
        bookworms). After taping up her signage, she sits across the street with
        a notebook and keeps track of:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            How many people pass by the door
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How many of those people notice the sign
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How many of them stop and knock
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            How many times they knock (the more they knock, the more interested
            they must be)
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            The age, gender, and other relevant characteristics of each knocker
            (\fsp{e.g.}, middle-aged well-dressed male professional; female college
            student).
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        She runs her
        experiment on both weekdays and weekends to see if and how the amount
        and composition of the pedestrian traffic changes.

        After a few days, Antonia has collected a lot of great YODA.
        Unfortunately, the data doesn't support her market hypothesis---not even
        close. At one location she counted a grand total of 3 people knocking
        out of 4,000 people passing by (that's less than 0.1\textpercent{} of
        the foot traffic). In another, she counted over 5,000 people and not a
        single knock.

        Antonia is disappointed in the result, but she is also relieved that she
        was able to collect this data and test her market hypothesis so quickly,
        with very little money---and without leaving her job. Pretotyping saved
        her from a potentially disastrous business decision.

        Does this mean that Antonia should give up on her bookstore idea? No,
        not at this point. But it does mean that she cannot count on just a door
        sign to get people into the store---she needs to revise her MEH, and she
        may have to adjust her plan to include some advertising budget, at least
        at first. She also begins to wonder if, as much as she likes the idea of
        a physical bookstore, perhaps her idea for selling antique books would
        work better online. The Fake Door pretotype proved quick and effective
        in the real world, so she wonders if she can use it online. Of course
        she can, just like her friend Sandy, who is the squirrel aficionado in
        our next example.

        \subsection{Example: A Guide to Squirrel Watching}

        Sandy is thinking about writing a book about her passion: squirrel
        watching (a rodent variation on the already popular hobby of
        birdwatching). Sandy knows that most books fail in the market. So before
        investing months of precious time away from actual
        squirrel watching to
        write her tome, she wants to gauge the level of interest in such a book.
        An online Fake Door pretotype is a very effective way to do that.

        First, Sandy buys the SquirrelWatching.com domain (\textdollar{}10). Then, using a
        free DIY website design tool, she creates a basic website. The site's
        landing page consists of a mocked-up version of her book, along with a
        brief description of what the book is about, a short bio of the author,
        and a \quotation{Buy Now for \textdollar{}20} button. When people click on the \quotation{Buy} button,
        they are redirected to another web page that displays the following
        message:

        \startmiddlealignment
          Fellow Squirrel Enthusiasts,

          Thank you for your interest in

          {\em A Guide to Squirrel Watching}.

          I am hard at work on the book, but it's

          not quite ready for publication.

          If you want to reserve your first-edition copy,

          enter your email in the form below, and I'll let

          you know as soon as the book is available.

          In the meantime, happy squirrel watching,

          and don't forget your rabies shot!

          Sandy (Squirrelgirl) Watson
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Once the Fake Door website for the book is up and running, she needs a
        way to let squirrel enthusiasts around the world know about it. She
        composes a web ad:

        \startmiddlealignment
          Do you like stalking squirrels?

          Go to www.SquirrelWatching.com

          to preorder {\em A Guide to Squirrel Watching}

          by Sandy Watson. Only \textdollar{}20.00.
        \stopmiddlealignment

        Then she invests
        \textdollar{}60 to have her ad displayed on nature-related websites and as a
        sponsored link whenever people do squirrel-related online searches.

        Now she's all set to collect her YODA. When people click on her ad, they
        are redirected to her website, where they have the option of submitting
        their email (a bit of skin in the game) to be alerted when the book is
        ready. Executing this Fake Door pretotype will cost as little as \textdollar{}100,
        take just a few hours of work, and require minimal technical
        skills---but it will provide Sandy with invaluable YODA.

        For example, by dividing the amount she spent on ads by the number of
        clicks on the \quotation{Buy} button, she can determine her customer acquisition
        cost (or CAC). If \textdollar{}60 spent on ads results in, say, 15 \quotation{Buy Now for
        \textdollar{}20} clicks, her CAC will be around \textdollar{}4 (\textdollar{}60 divided by 15)---a
        promising result, since \textdollar{}60 in ads would have resulted in \textdollar{}300 in
        sales. If, on the other hand, she only manages to get 1 or 2 \quotation{Buy}
        clicks, she might have to revisit either her marketing (the website
        design, the wording of the ad, \fsp{etc.}) or her Market Engagement
        Hypothesis. In either case, Sandy would get some hard, firsthand data to
        help her decide whether to write her book.

        \subsection{More on the Ethics of Fake Door Pretotypes}

        I know that we've already touched on the potential ethical issues
        associated with this pretotyping technique, but I want to talk about it
        a bit more, because I know that many people (including myself) care
        about such things. Did Antonia and Sandy do something ethically wrong,
        or at least questionable, in order to find out if their ideas are The
        Right It?

        Assuming that you are not interested in an elaborate philosophical
        discussion of Antonia and Sandy's actions, one way
        to analyze the
        ethics of Fake Door pretotypes is by considering possible scenarios in
        which Antonia and Sandy do {\em not} use this pretotype, but rely on
        other methods to evaluate their MEHs.

        Instead of using a Fake Door pretotype to collect YODA, Antonia decides
        to go the market-survey route. Armed with a notepad, she plants herself
        at the corner of Main and Oak (the area where she's thinking of opening
        her bookstore) and asks passersby:

        \startnarrow
          Do you think this street could use a great antique bookstore?
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          Would you visit such a store? How many times a year?
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          How many books a year do you think you might buy?
        \stopnarrow

        Antonia's body and notepad may be at the corner of Main and Oak, but
        (cue in {\em Twilight Zone} theme music) her data comes from another
        dimension, from a world inhabited by ideas and opinions, a place we call
        Thoughtland.

        Antonia's Thoughtland-based \quotation{research} indicates a great need for the
        kind of store she has in mind. Most people (77\textpercent{}) say
        they'd love an antique bookstore and would shop there regularly for
        themselves and for gifts for other people. An elderly woman comments,
        \quotation{Old books make such unique and thoughtful gifts for my friends. And I
        have many friends, you know. I'd buy at least a few books each month
        from you.} A college student says she spends at least \textdollar{}100 on books
        each month and would love a local bookstore. But not everyone is so
        enthusiastic and optimistic; a few people warn her that, given that
        other local bookstores closed due to a lack of customers, she is
        unlikely to succeed. But Antonia subconsciously ignores those naysayers
        (confirmation bias) as she crunches her numbers and makes her plans.

        Eventually, she
        comes up with sales projections of over \textdollar{}14,000 per month. Empowered by
        this projection, she quits her job, gets a \textdollar{}100,000 loan, signs a
        three-year lease on a space, buys a bunch of old books, and holds a
        grand opening. Six months later she has a not-so-grand closing. She's
        more than \textdollar{}100,000 in debt and jobless. Pretty painful for Antonia,
        wouldn't you say?

        Similarly, instead of enjoying time outdoors watching squirrels chase
        each other's tails, Sandy makes the decision to go ahead with her book
        based solely on the opinions of her family, her friends, and a retired
        park ranger who says, \quotation{Everyone I know loves squirrels and is super
        interested in them.} She spends two years at her desk and several
        thousand dollars to write and self-publish her book. And now she avoids
        going into her garage because she can't bear to see those fifty boxes of
        unsold books.

        In both of these scenarios, by depending on opinions instead of data
        Antonia and Sandy fall victim to the Law of Market Failure and
        Thoughtland's false positives. They commiserate over a couple of bottles
        of Chardonnay and wonder where they went wrong.

        \quotation{Most of the people I interviewed seemed so positive and excited about
        the bookstore. Where did they all go?} asks Antonia before taking a big
        gulp of wine. \quotation{Doesn't anyone buy books anymore?}

        \quotation{Well, they ain't buying mine for sure,} answers Sandy, refilling her
        glass. \quotation{I spent so much damn time and money on that squirrel book~.~.~.
        I don't think I can bear to look at another one of those rodents again.}

        Now think again about the original scenarios in which Antonia and Sandy
        used the Fake Door pretotype, described above. Antonia was out \textdollar{}22 and
        a few hours of her time. The few people who actually knocked on the Fake
        Door were initially
        disappointed, but
        they forgot all about it a minute later. No real harm done.

        In Sandy's case, the time spent and inconvenience caused to the few
        people who clicked on her Fake Door online ad for the squirrel book are
        negligible compared to the time, money, and effort she was about to put
        into writing and publishing a book too few people would be interested
        in.

        I hope you would agree that, in both Antonia's and Sandy's cases, the
        second scenario causes more pain and waste than the first one. The few
        minutes of people's time wasted knocking or clicking on the fake doors
        are negligible compared to Antonia's and Sandy's potential losses.

        Each year, millions of people just like Antonia and Sandy launch
        products, services, and businesses that fail in the market. Think of the
        cost to society for all the failed businesses and products that nobody
        wants. Think of the millions of unsold products that, after a huge
        investment in development, production, advertising, and shipping, end up
        in the garbage. Unless you are in the bankruptcy or landfill business,
        wouldn't you prefer to have people like Antonia and Sandy either
        gainfully employed or running a successful business---and not in debt or
        collecting unemployment?

        Not only that, but people who are not interested in the Fake Door offer
        are not going to knock on the door or click on the ads---so they suffer
        no inconvenience. And by knocking or clicking on the Fake Door offer,
        the people who are interested in the idea and might actually want the
        bookstore or the squirrel book to exist are, in a sense, \quotation{voting} for it
        and thus increasing the probability that the idea will become a reality.

        Even with these rationalizations, you can probably understand why the
        Fake Door is, as I mentioned, both my favorite and my least favorite
        technique. I love the fact that it can be
        executed so quickly
        and inexpensively, making it possible to collect real-world data in a
        matter of hours. But I am still somewhat bothered by the minor deception
        involved. If that bothers you too, I offer two solutions.

        The first solution is to be up front with and reward the people who
        knock on your fake door or click on your \quotation{Buy} button. For example,
        after a person knocks on the bookstore's fake door, Antonia can walk up
        to them, admit that she was just running a test, apologize, and perhaps
        even give the person a \textdollar{}10 Amazon gift certificate to buy a book. Sandy
        can do something similar with her Fake Door website; perhaps give all
        people who click the \quotation{Buy} button a free one-page guide to squirrel
        identification or some other inexpensive squirrel-related gift. If you
        decide to use a Fake Door pretotype, I encourage you to do something
        similar---turn it into a win-win: potential customers get a free gift,
        and you get your YODA without a guilt trip.

        The second solution is to use a variation of the Fake Door pretotype,
        the Facade pretotype, which I share with you next.

        \section{The Facade Pretotype}

        The Facade pretotype differs from the Fake Door in one important
        respect---when potential customers knock on that door or click that
        \quotation{Buy} button, someone answers and something happens. They may even get
        precisely what they were looking for. Let me illustrate this technique
        with a great example.

        \subsection{Example: CarsDirect}

        At the dawn of the internet age, IdeaLabs CEO and world-class innovator
        Bill Gross envisioned an online car-selling service.
        Such a website is
        something we take for granted these days, but at the time it was a very
        novel idea and market success was far from certain. Before making a
        major investment, before even having a single car in inventory, Bill
        Gross validated the idea using what we will call a Facade pretotype.
        Here's how he explains it:

        \startnarrow
          In 1999, we started CarsDirect. Back then people worried about putting
          credit cards online; here I wanted to sell a car online! We put a site
          up on a Wednesday night; by Thursday morning, we had four orders. We
          quickly shut the site down (we'd have to buy four cars at retail and
          deliver them to these four customers at a loss), but proved the thesis.
          Only then did we start building the real site and
          company.\footnote{Bill Gross, \quotation{Here Are
          the 12 Lessons I've Learned in My 30 Years of Being an Entrepreneur,}
          \goto{\hyphenatedurl{http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gross-lessons-2011-12\#would-anyone-actually-buy-a-car-online-29}}[url(http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gross-lessons-2011-12\#would-anyone-actually-buy-a-car-online-29)].}
        \stopnarrow

        Even though CarsDirect had zero cars to sell, the website that it put up
        that Wednesday night is considered a Facade pretotype and not a Fake
        Door. Had it been a Fake Door, when people clicked \quotation{Buy} next to a photo
        and description of a car, they would have received a message along the
        lines of, \quotation{Sorry, the car you wanted is no longer available.}

        But instead of getting an apology and an excuse in exchange for their
        involuntary participation in a market-research experiment, the first few
        people who clicked \quotation{Buy} on that CarsDirect website soon had the car
        they wanted sitting in their driveway. And what did Bill Gross and his
        team get? The best form of validation for the idea: YODA with lots of
        skin in the game. And the very best type of skin in the game: four
        checks for a few thousand dollars each.

        A Facade pretotype
        requires more investment and commitment than a Fake Door, so why would
        you choose it over the faster, cheaper Fake Door? Well, depending on the
        idea and situation, the added investment might be worth it. First, as
        I've already mentioned, for some categories of products and services,
        using a Fake Door pretotype might be unethical or downright illegal, for
        example, if you pretend that you have a cure for some disease.

        Second, you can learn a lot more about your potential business with a
        Facade than you can with just a Fake Door. In the CarsDirect example,
        Bill Gross and his team not only validated the demand for the service
        (\fsp{i.e.}, people's willingness to buy cars online), but in the process of
        delivering actual cars to their initial set of customers, they also
        learned firsthand about the necessary financial and legal paperwork
        required and about the back-end process associated with each sale. Not
        to mention that checks for a few thousand dollars each from several
        customers are more compelling and convincing evidence for potential
        investors than a spreadsheet showing how many people knocked on a door
        or clicked on a \quotation{Buy} button.

        \subsection{Example: Antonia's Antique Bookstore Revisited}

        We've already seen how Antonia pretotyped her bookstore using a Fake
        Door with a minimal investment of time and money. Had she been willing
        to invest a bit more in exchange for learning a bit more about her
        market and customers, a Facade pretotype would have served her well. She
        could pretotype her brick-and-mortar business doing something similar to
        what CarsDirect did online.

        Instead of simply putting a sign on the door of some vacant building or
        store, she could make arrangements to rent the space
        behind that door for
        just a few days and put a desk in front of a couple of bookcases filled
        with books she already owns. When people knock and come in the store,
        she explains that she's still working on her book inventory. But if the
        customers already have an idea of the kind of books they are interested
        in, she'd be happy to help them find those books. Here's how such an
        interaction might go.

        A potential customer opens the door expecting rows of bookshelves
        stuffed with thousands of books and is surprised to see just a couple of
        bookcases and a desk where Antonia is working on a computer.

        \quotation{Oops, sorry. I thought this was a bookstore,} says the customer.

        \quotation{Oh, but it is,} answers Antonia with a beaming smile. \quotation{Or it will be,
        once all my inventory arrives.}

        After getting out from behind her desk and shaking hands with the still
        slightly confused potential customer, she explains: \quotation{My name is Antonia.
        I'm just getting started, testing the waters and the neighborhood, so to
        speak. But I can already help you. Are you looking for any specific
        books?}

        \quotation{Actually, I am very interested in Stoic philosophy and wanted to see if
        you had any interesting or unusual books on that subject for my
        collection.}

        \quotation{Ah, yes, the Stoics. I believe a beautiful leather-bound
        nineteenth-century translation of Marcus Aurelius's {\em Meditations} is
        available. It's not cheap though, about \textdollar{}200. Would you like me to look
        it up and order it for you? Or are you looking for something a bit less
        expensive?}

        \quotation{Sure, if it's not too much trouble. I don't mind spending that much if
        the book is worth it.}

        \quotation{No trouble at all. By the way, while the computer searches
        for it, may I ask
        you---book lover to book lover---about your book collection~.~.~.}

        As you can see, with a Facade pretotype, Antonia will be able to capture
        much more data than just how many people knock on the door. She can get
        an idea of the type of people who would come into the bookstore, the
        kind of books they'd be looking for, and the price range with which they
        would be comfortable.

        As you can probably tell from these examples, I love books. But I also
        love movies and videos---and not just for learning and entertainment,
        but also for pretotyping, as we shall see in this next section.

        \section{The YouTube Pretotype}

        Since their invention, movies and videos have helped us imagine and
        experience events, places, and devices that don't yet exist (\fsp{e.g.},
        spaceships, time machines)---they've helped us {\em pretend}. This makes
        videos a natural tool for pretotyping. The YouTube pretotyping technique
        takes advantage of the \quotation{magic of movies} to bring to life product ideas
        that are not yet fully developed or widely available, so you can share
        them with your target market (using YouTube or any other video platform
        or device) in order to collect YODA about the market's interest in your
        idea.

        \subsection{Example: Google Glass Explorer Edition}

        Google Glass is the name for an optical head-mounted display in the
        shape of a pair of eyeglasses. In addition to the ability to display
        information directly on the lenses, Glass contains a camera so the
        wearer can surreptitiously record or broadcast a video of what he or she
        is seeing. Well before Glass was ready for
        prime time, the team
        working on it made a video showing what the world would look like
        through Google Glass. It was a given that such a visionary (pun
        intended) concept---especially one coming from Google---would generate a
        lot of buzz and interest, but would that buzz and interest translate
        into commitment? Were enough people willing to invest real money to get
        their own pair of Google Glass? How would they use it? And, more
        important, would they keep using it after the initial geeky excitement
        wore off?

        Sure enough, once the video introducing Glass was posted on YouTube, the
        buzz started big time. Everyone was talking about it; everyone had a
        prediction about how Glass would (or not) dramatically change the way we
        interact with the world. No surprises here, but also no data---just a
        bunch of Thoughtland opinions and speculations. How many people would
        actually be willing to part with some serious cash to buy a pair of
        Google Glass? And, even more important, how many of them would use it
        regularly? What would they use it for?

        In order to turn a video of your yet-to-be-developed idea into a
        legitimate pretotype, you must use it to collect more than online views,
        thumbs-ups, or comments. You must find a way to turn that video into a
        YODA-generating experiment.

        The Glass team accomplished that by following the video demonstration
        with an offer to join the Google Glass Explorer program. To qualify for
        the Explorer program, you had to put quite a bit of skin in the game.
        First, you had to express interest by posting a message on Twitter using
        the \texthash{}IfIHadGlass hashtag and describe what you'd do with Glass if you
        had it (\fsp{e.g.}, \texthash{}IfIHadGlass I would use it for a cooking show).

        Thousands of people posted tweets with their ideas for using Glass.
        After reviewing these tweets, the Glass team selected
        a few thousand tweet
        authors and notified them that they had been accepted into the Explorer
        program. All they had to do to join was to pay \textdollar{}1,500 for their Google
        Glass and travel (at their own expense) to a Google office in San
        Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York for fitting and training.

        Now that's quite an investment of money and time---lots of skin in the
        game. Nevertheless, many people paid the fee, made the trip, sat through
        the training, and returned home with their own pair of Google Glass. At
        first, the Explorers were enthusiastic, some of them perhaps a bit too
        enthusiastic. A well-known tech blogger, for example, was so taken with
        Glass that he posted a photo of himself wearing them in the shower.

        Unfortunately, the initial wave of interest was soon followed by a wave
        of criticism and a major backlash. Perhaps out of envy, perhaps because
        of the fact that they could be secretly recording a video, Google Glass
        wearers quickly went from being the focus of attention to being called
        \quotation{glassholes.} Many bars and restaurants banned their use. And, worst of
        all, after the initial period of excitement, most Glass Explorers
        stopped wearing them.

        Although Glass showed a lot of promise for some applications, the
        original set of expectations was not met, and the Glass project was
        canceled. The idea may be resurrected in some other form or for some
        other market, but---despite all the initial hype---this particular
        version of the technology at this particular time was not The Right It.

        You might wonder if this is a case of pretotyping giving a false
        positive---just like those focus groups and other Thoughtland techniques
        I criticized. After all, initial interest was high, and many people were
        willing to pay \textdollar{}1,500 for Glass. Quite the contrary. Google Glass is a
        great example of how, for some products, initial levels of interest and
        commitment are necessary, but
        not sufficient to
        determine if a product is The Right It. The success of some products and
        services depends on {\em repeated} use and {\em continued} engagement.

        It's relatively easy, especially for companies like Google and Apple, to
        create a lot of buzz for a new idea. The real test is whether that
        initial buzz translates into ongoing interest and consistent usage. By
        combining the YouTube pretotype with the Explorer program, Google not
        only determined the initial level of interest in the product, but was
        also able to track how many of those initially enthusiastic Explorers
        remained enthusiastic after the initial excitement wore off.

        Of course, the Google Glass team was disappointed, but they had never
        assumed success. If that were the case, they would have jumped ahead to
        manufacturing and tried to sell hundreds of thousands of units instead
        of validating the idea first.

        Because in the movies anything is possible, the YouTube technique can be
        used to pretotype any idea. But remember that metrics like views or
        thumbs-ups don't count as data. The key is to combine a video that shows
        your idea in action with a way to collect skin in the game.

        The YouTube pretotype can often be combined with another pretotyping
        technique for even better results. Let me illustrate the power of this
        approach using some of my previous examples.

        \subsection{Example: The Smart Horn Revisited}

        A few pages earlier, we used the Pinocchio technique to pretotype the
        Smart Horn idea. We installed four dummy buttons for four different horn
        sounds in our car to see if, when, and how often we would use them. We
        can combine the Pinocchio with the YouTube pretotype by making a video
        that shows the various buttons and sounds in action. We begin by
        recording a video of
        someone driving around in a Smart Horn--equipped car, showing how it
        would be used in various situations. A driver distracted by being on the
        phone does not notice the light has turned green and is given a polite
        {\em beep-beep}. Someone cuts our driver off and hears a more assertive
        \quotation{You \texthash{}\textdollar{}\textpercent{}^&*!}

        Of course, no Smart Horn exists yet, so those buttons don't do anything,
        but that's where the magic of video comes in. With a little editing, you
        can add the appropriate horn sounds to the video soundtrack and create
        the illusion that the Smart Horn actually works. Once you have such a
        video, you can post it online and give people who watch it an
        opportunity to preorder it or give you their email to receive more
        information about it.

        \subsection{Example: The Portable Pollution Sensor Revisited}

        In addition to showing the product-to-be in action, the YouTube
        pretotype gives you a wonderful opportunity for testing various stories
        or scenarios for marketing your idea. Remember the portable
        pollution-sensor idea we introduced in a previous chapter? The team
        believed that their first target market should be parents of children
        who live in very polluted cities. To validate their market hypothesis,
        they can make a video that tells a story of how two concerned parents
        used the portable pollution monitor to keep their daughter healthy by
        not letting her spend too much time outside when pollution levels are
        too high. For pretotyping purposes, the pollution-sensor device shown in
        the video can be simulated by any nonfunctional object whose shape and
        dimensions are similar to the ones they are envisioning for the actual
        product.

        \subsection{Example: FeeBird}

        One product category that is ideally suited for the YouTube pretotype is
        software. By turning a PowerPoint (or Apple
        Keynote)
        presentation into a video, you can simulate the functionality of any
        program or app you can envision without writing a single line of code.
        Let me give you an example.

        Let's say you have an idea for a mobile app called FeeBird. Your app
        makes it possible for bird-watchers (let's give squirrels a break for
        now) to earn money from their hobby by sharing the location of rare or
        elusive birds that they've spotted---for a fee. As the developer of
        FeeBird, you will make money by selling the app for \textdollar{}5 and by
        collecting 20\textpercent{} of each transaction.

        If you are a software developer, like me, you can't wait to fire up your
        computer and start coding. But let me ask you this: \quotation{Do you have any
        doubt that you can build such an app?} Of course not! It's just a SMOP
        (Small Matter of Programming). And even if you are not a software
        developer, you can safely assume that you can easily hire one to develop
        FeeBird for you. In other words, there is zero risk or uncertainty about
        building the app. There is, however, a nonzero cost associated with it.
        An app like this would take at least several weeks of work to develop,
        test, and debug. Since we know that most apps don't get many users or
        make much money, you should use pretotyping to make sure that FeeBird is
        The Right It before you make that investment.

        So instead of running to your computer and firing up your software
        development tools, fire up your favorite presentation or graphics
        software and use its capabilities to simulate what your app would do.
        Let me show you what I mean.

        Below are mock-ups of two FeeBird screens I put together on Apple
        Keynote in about ten minutes. The first screen shows the general
        location of an interesting bird near you, along with an option to buy a
        precise map/location for a fee of \textdollar{}5:

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image127.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        The second screen shows what happens if users decide to buy
        the detailed
        information: they get a detailed map, GPS coordinates, and a chance to
        rate the information.

        In less than one hour, you can create several such slides, each with a
        mock-up screen showing the result of a user action (search for bird,
        report a bird, confirm a sighting). You can then combine them in an
        animated sequence to make them look like a functioning app. For example,
        when you click on the slide with the \quotation{Buy} button, the screen
        transitions to the next slide, which shows the detailed information on
        the bird location---and it would look to the viewer as if the click on
        the \quotation{Buy} button worked. Once you have put together an animated
        sequence, add some narration to complete the demo:

        \startnarrow
          {\em After you've told FeeBird what kind of birds you are interested in,
          the Alert Screen will let you know whenever such a bird is spotted near
          you.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em Here, for
          example, you can see that there's an Atlantic Puffin within a ten-mile
          radius of your current location. For \textdollar{}5 you can get the precise
          location of the bird.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em You click on the \quotation{Buy} button and now you see a screen with
          detailed map, GPS coordinates, and directions.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em You drive to the location, hike a few hundred feet, and~.~.~.
          success, there's a pair of Atlantic Puffins. Delighted, you give a
          five-star rating to your fellow bird-watcher.}
        \stopnarrow

        At the end of this process, not only will you have a compelling and
        realistic-looking video demonstration of what your app will do, but you
        will have probably learned a lot about how you would design it and what
        features you would put into it.

        But this is not a pretotype yet; it's just a sophisticated, dynamic
        mock-up. To turn it into a pretotype you have to use this video to
        collect some data. You can do that in any number of ways. For example,
        you can create a dedicated website where you show the video and give
        people an opportunity to sign up to be notified when the app is
        released, or show the video at a bird-watching meeting and see if anyone
        is interested enough to give you some form of skin in the game (email
        address, money, \fsp{etc.}).

        \subsection{Return on Pretotyping Investment}

        This last example gives me an opportunity to introduce the concept of
        {\em return on pretotyping investment}: how a few dollars and hours
        invested in pretotyping an idea can save you from wasting a ton of money
        and time building The Wrong It.

        Let's assume that you've invested ten hours and \textdollar{}100 to create a
        polished YouTube pretotype of the FeeBird app in action,
        develop a simple
        website, and buy some online ads in order to collect some YODA. After
        one week, your video has collected two thousand views, a bunch of
        hostile comments (\fsp{e.g.}, \quotation{No self-respecting bird-watcher would charge or
        pay money for this kind of information}), and---most important---not a
        single piece of skin in the game. You make some changes, run another ad
        campaign, and get similar results. You decide to try another tack, so
        you show your video at a meeting of bird-watchers---and you are booed
        off the stage. Ouch! Time to go back to the drawing board.

        This outcome may be disappointing. But imagine how much more
        disappointed you would have been if, instead of ten hours, you had
        invested ten {\em weeks} (roughly four hundred hours of engineering time
        worth thousands of dollars) to develop a real app, only to find out
        exactly the same information about your market (\fsp{i.e.}, zero sales and
        that most bird-watchers recoil at the premise of buying or selling such
        information). Ten hours and \textdollar{}100 versus four hundred hours and
        thousands of dollars to learn the same lesson---that's a darn good
        return on your pretotyping investment, wouldn't you say?

        Test a little before you invest a lot. Don't jump in bed with an idea
        until you've gotten to know it a bit better. And speaking of jumping in
        bed, let's move on to the next pretotyping technique.

        \section{The One-Night Stand Pretotype}

        I named the One-Night Stand pretotype after the performing-art practice
        of holding a single performance of a play or show at a particular
        place---but go ahead and associate it with the more salacious use of the
        term if you prefer.

        As the name
        suggests, the main characteristic of the One-Night Stand pretotype is
        the lack of a long-term commitment or investment. It does not
        necessarily have to be exactly one night or one shot, by the way; don't
        take the name too literally. The duration of the pretotype experiment
        can be as brief as a couple of hours or as long as a couple of months;
        the point is that it's a relatively short-term commitment---just the
        time you need to collect enough data to make an informed decision. If
        you want 100 data points and you can get them in one day or with a
        single experiment, then make it one day and one experiment. If it will
        take you a week and multiple experiments to get the necessary data, take
        a week. Having said that, two of my favorite examples of One-Night Stand
        pretotypes in action come from Virgin Airlines and Airbnb, both of which
        began with a one-shot/one-night offer.

        \subsection{Example: Virgin Airlines}

        In the early 1980s, legendary entrepreneur Richard Branson had booked a
        flight to the British Virgin Islands to meet his then girlfriend for a
        romantic vacation. When his flight was canceled, instead of moaning,
        groaning, and cursing the airline---as most of us would have done---he
        decided to create his own One-Night Stand Airline. He borrowed a
        blackboard, wrote on it \quotation{Virgin Airlines / \textdollar{}39 one-way ticket to BVI,}
        rounded up a bunch of the other passengers who had been bumped, and sold
        enough tickets to fill a chartered plane.

        Encouraged by this successful experiment, he returned from his romantic
        vacation and decided to call Boeing: \quotation{Do you have any used 747s for
        sale?} They did. Branson grabbed one and stepped up from a one-flight
        pretotype to a one-plane airline pretotype. Eventually, Virgin Airlines
        went on to become one
        of the most
        successful and innovative airlines in the industry. Branson's girlfriend
        must have also been quite impressed because she ended up marrying him.

        \subsection{Example: Airbnb}

        Sometime in 2007, two Airbnb cofounders, Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky,
        could not pay the monthly rent for their San Francisco residence. To
        make some quick cash, they came up with the idea of renting out three
        air mattresses in one of their apartment's rooms (hence the \quotation{air} in the
        Airbnb name) and, perhaps to make up for the somewhat uncomfortable
        sleeping conditions, included a home-cooked breakfast in the deal (hence
        the \quotation{bnb} in the name). They bought the airbed andbreakfast.com domain,
        created a simple one-page website with a map showing the location of
        their apartment, and advertised it on Craigslist. A few hours later,
        they had two men and one woman signed up for their
        one-night-plus-one-breakfast deal, paying \textdollar{}80 each.

        That's skin in the game---quite literally. Those three Airbnb pioneer
        customers risked their skin when they agreed to spend the night in a
        room with two strangers in the home of other strangers. I don't know
        about you, but all kinds of horror-movie plots come to mind; I am not
        sure I would have slept very peacefully that night. In fact, if someone
        had described this as an idea for a business, my Thoughtland-based
        opinion would have been: \quotation{It will never work. I'd never pay to spend the
        night in a stranger's home. What's wrong with a hotel---or a proper
        bed-and-breakfast?} This is another great example of how wrong our
        initial reactions, opinions, and predictions can be, because when I'm
        traveling these days, Airbnb is the first website I check, and more
        often than not, I end up booking one of its homes.

        After the first
        guests left, Joe and Brian realized that this could be a big idea: The
        Right It. A few years later, with lots done right and going right,
        Airbnb was worth over \textdollar{}10 billion. I suspect that Joe and Brian don't
        worry about being able to pay their rent anymore.

        \subsection{Example: Tesla's Pop-Up Showroom}

        Not only is opening up an auto dealership really expensive, it's a
        long-term commitment to one particular location. What if that location
        doesn't work out for some hard-to-foresee reason? How can you get some
        data to guide your decision? It sounds like a perfect job for the
        One-Night Stand pretotype.

        To expose its cars to new markets and test the level of interest in
        those markets, Tesla designed and built a portable pop-up auto showroom
        consisting of two modified shipping containers that could be easily
        trucked to a location and then expanded into a 20- by 35-foot showcase
        in a matter of hours. Not only could potential customers experience the
        cars firsthand, they would also have an opportunity to make a \textdollar{}5,000
        deposit and place an order online---lots of skin in the game. The pop-up
        store could provide Tesla with great firsthand data on how well its cars
        would sell in a particular location with minimal commitment---brilliant!

        Let's say that Tesla wants to open a new dealership in the greater Los
        Angeles area, but first it wants to figure out which LA location will
        result in the most sales. The presence and success of other luxury car
        dealerships in an area might be a good starting point, but it's OPD
        (Other People's Data), and you can't automatically assume that the
        people who buy from traditional luxury or sports car makers, such as
        Bentley, Mercedes, Cadillac, Ferrari, or Lamborghini, are the same
        people who would buy a Tesla. Tesla knows that its stores attract a lot
        of interest wherever
        it puts them, but
        how many of the people who visit a particular store are tire kickers and
        how many are serious potential buyers?

        Tesla can use existing data to narrow down its options to three possible
        locations within a 20-mile radius and then combine its pop-up showroom
        with a One-Night Stand pretotype and an xyz hypothesis (\fsp{e.g.}, at least
        0.5\textpercent{} of people who walk into the Beverly Hills showroom
        will place a deposit for a Tesla Model S) and get some valuable
        YODA---not \quotation{This is a good location for a luxury car dealership,} but
        \quotation{This is a good location for a {\em Tesla} dealership.}

        \subsection{Test a Little Before You Invest a Lot}

        As with most pretotyping techniques, the One-Night Stand seems obvious
        in retrospect; it's a simple matter of applying the \quotation{test a little
        before you invest a lot} concept to the dimension of time: try it one
        time or for a few hours, days, or weeks. In other words, before making a
        long-term commitment, validate your long-term XYZ Hypothesis with a
        short-term xyz experiment.

        But rational ideas, no matter how obvious they might be, don't always
        translate into rational actions. When I look at how most people and
        organizations approach investing in a new idea, I see the exact opposite
        happening: organizations sign long-term commercial-space leases and make
        all kinds of long-term commitments without the data necessary to prove
        that their idea will work.

        In the past, I've been as guilty of this as anyone. In the businesses I
        started, I regularly signed long-term leases for thousands of square
        feet of space (enough for dozens of employees in engineering, sales,
        marketing, operations, \fsp{etc.}), even though at the time we had just a few
        employees, we were at least one year away from having a product we could
        sell, and the only validation we had for our product was a bunch of
        opinions with no skin in the game.

        \section{The Infiltrator Pretotype}

        Sometimes creating or manufacturing a new product on a small scale
        requires minimal investment and little risk. The big risk is investing
        too much to build it right and manufacture that new product in quantity
        before you have enough data to confirm that there is sufficient interest
        or demand for it. Wouldn't it be great if you could use a small
        batch---perhaps even just a single unit---of your idea and leverage
        someone else's marketing and sales resources to see if anyone would buy
        it?

        That's where the Infiltrator pretotype comes in. As the name suggests,
        the Infiltrator technique involves sneaking your product into someone
        else's existing sales environment (it could be physical stores or
        online) where similar products are normally purchased to see if people
        will be interested enough to put some skin in the game and buy it.

        \subsection{Example: Walhub}

        My inspiration for and favorite example of this pretotyping technique
        comes from Justin Porcano, who leads an independent design firm in San
        Francisco called Upwell Design. Justin had an idea for an innovative
        switch plate, that rectangular piece of plastic or metal that goes
        around a light switch to protect the wall from finger smudges. His
        switch-plate design, which he called the Walhub, has hooks and pockets
        that you can use to conveniently hang or store things like keys,
        umbrellas, or flashlights. You can put a Walhub, for example, on the
        switch near your front door to secure your keys and hold letters that
        you have to mail or near the cellar door to hold a flashlight in case
        the lights go out and you have to check the breakers in the basement.

        Like all inventors, Justin thought that his idea was great and
        believed that other
        people would see its usefulness and buy it. He also thought that home
        improvement and furniture stores, like IKEA or Home Depot, would be a
        great place to sell it. However, unlike most inventors, Justin was wise
        enough to seek data to validate his beliefs (smart man!) and came up
        with a unique way to do that.

        First, Justin went on eBay and bought a used IKEA employee shirt. Next,
        he created a few official-looking IKEA product labels and price tags and
        put them on a handful of early prototypes of the Walhub. As a final
        clever touch, since IKEA is famous for its quirky Nordic-sounding names,
        for the purposes of this experiment he changed the name of his product
        from Walhub to Wälhub to make it even more believable.

        With a couple of accomplices, he infiltrated the local IKEA store
        wearing a yellow employee shirt and carrying a bagful of Wälhubs. After
        looking around to make sure no real IKEA employees were nearby, he
        proceeded to put a handful of Wälhubs on display in several areas of the
        store where IKEA shoppers had a chance to see them---and purchase them.
        Since he was wearing an official-looking IKEA shirt, other employees
        assumed he was one of their colleagues setting up a new display.

        Then he stood back to observe how people reacted to his product. How
        many people would stop to check it out? How many, if any, would put a
        Wälhub in their big blue IKEA bag and buy it, thinking it was a bona
        fide IKEA product? Which location within the store (\fsp{e.g.}, kitchen,
        living room, garage) resulted in the most interest and sales?

        It turns out that people were interested in the Wälhub, and several
        shoppers put one in their shopping bag and headed for the checkout. As
        you can imagine, Justin's fake IKEA price tags did not scan properly,
        and the cashiers did not recognize that product.
        Despite a bit of
        confusion at the checkout stand, in the end everyone who tried to buy a
        Wälhub was able to take it home for free. This was a win-win: customers
        got a freebie, and Upwell Design got valuable YODA. Justin and his team
        filmed the whole experiment and posted a short video on YouTube (search
        for \quotation{Upwell Walhub Ikea}). The video is well worth seeking out, because
        it's quite inspiring to watch the technique in action, and it's also
        quite funny.

        What a brilliant way to validate an idea and to go from opinions to
        data. When it comes to skin in the game, customers putting a Wälhub in
        their bag expecting to pay for it is as good as it gets. Here's an
        example of the kind of YODA Justin might have collected using the
        Infiltrator pretotype:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Duration of experiment: one hour
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Number of people who walked by the display: 240
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Number of people who picked up a Wälhub to check it out: 12
            (5\textpercent{})
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Number of people who tried to buy a Wälhub: 3 (1.25\textpercent{})
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Of course, what Justin did took more than creativity; it took guts and
        it involved risk. I don't know the penalty for infiltrating a major
        chain store pretending to be an employee of that store and using its
        retail space for your own market-research purposes. But I suspect that,
        if caught, you might get into some trouble---or get a lot of press and
        attention for your product (which is exactly what happened in this
        case).

        The good news is that you can use the very same technique without having
        to risk being arrested. It's not as exciting as infiltrating an IKEA
        store under false pretenses, but Justin could have offered several
        independent hardware store owners a bit of money (say \textdollar{}100) in exchange
        for putting his product on display
        in their store for a
        couple of weeks to see if anyone would buy it.

        Let me end this example with a few words from the daring Justin Porcano
        about his IKEA experiment:

        \startnarrow
          The results were better than I could've hoped for. The experiment helped
          to not only validate a consumer market for the product, but it revealed
          information about the effectiveness of the packaging, the price point,
          and ideal locations within a retail space. Beyond the research aspect of
          the experiment we used the video as a marketing tool. We received 75,000
          YouTube views, an interview on national TV, and creative accolades from
          press outlets like Advertising Age. Upwell was able to stretch a \textdollar{}600
          marketing budget about as far as it would go while receiving valuable
          sales and market
          research.\footnote{\goto{\hyphenatedurl{http://www.upwelldesign.com/portfolio/walhub-hacks-ikea-video/}}[url(http://www.upwelldesign.com/portfolio/walhub-hacks-ikea-video/)].}
        \stopnarrow

        It's fun, exciting, and illuminating to run an Infiltrator pretotype in
        brick-and-mortar stores, because you can not only keep track of numbers,
        but also observe how people react to your product. If most people pick
        up your product, look at the price, let out a whistle, and put it back,
        you can safely deduce that they think it's too expensive. However, since
        a significant---and growing---amount of shopping has migrated to online
        stores, you might wonder if you can run an Infiltrator pretotype on the
        internet. Of course you can! And you should. Taking advantage of an
        established website's traffic is almost always a much cheaper and faster
        option that trying to attract traffic to a new website.

        First, you need to identify an existing online retailer with an
        established client base that already buys products in the same category
        as yours. Next, you contact the retailer and work out a
        deal to display your
        product on a trial basis. In exchange for the data you will collect, for
        example, you can offer to let the retailer keep any of the revenue from
        the sales or throw in a few dollars to \quotation{rent} a bit of its online
        presence---it will be well worth it. As always, it's easier to contact
        and work with smaller businesses than giant corporations to run this
        kind of trial.

        \section{The Relabel Pretotype}

        The Relabel pretotype takes advantage of the fact that with a minor
        change in external appearance, we can leverage an existing product or
        service to pretotype a new product or service. By putting a different
        label on a product, you can pretend that it's something other than what
        it is---and see if people are interested in it.

        Sounds fishy? Not really, but this pretotyping technique did have a
        fishy origin.

        \subsection{Example: Second-Day Sushi}

        A few years ago, while I was having lunch with a small group of Stanford
        undergraduates, a plastic box of prepackaged sushi pieces, the lunch
        choice of one of the students, triggered the following conversation:

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{How's that sushi in a plastic box?} asked one of the students
          between chomps of a cheeseburger.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{Expensive! Almost ten bucks~.~.~. but at least they gave me a free
          pair of chopsticks.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{I think it's a rip-off,} interjected a third student, who was
          eating a bowl of chili. \quotation{There's no reason for it to be so expensive;
          it's just a bunch of rice with a few little pieces of fish.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{Ah, but the
          fish has to be really fresh---and fresh fish is expensive,} replied
          Cheeseburger Guy.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{I bet that I could feed you not-so-fresh sushi, and with all that
          soy sauce and wasabi you couldn't tell the difference,} said Chili Gal.
          \quotation{In fact, I bet you there would be a big market for cheap sushi.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{Yeah, right. I can already see it. Second-Day Sushi. Better go
          grab that domain name right now,} said Cheeseburger Guy, laughing.}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{Actually, I don't think it's such a bad idea,} said Sushi Man. \quotation{If
          it were reasonably tasty, safe to eat, and cheap enough, I'd consider
          Second-Day Sushi. Heck, I'd eat sushi every day if I could afford it.}}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em \quotation{I doubt it,} said Cheeseburger Guy. \quotation{And even if you were crazy
          enough to actually go for it, no sane person would risk food poisoning
          or worse just to save a few bucks.}}
        \stopnarrow

        Normally, I avoid work-related conversations when I am eating, but in
        this case I could not resist turning this Thoughtlandish exchange of
        opinions into a teachable moment: \quotation{You know, we could settle this matter
        with a pretotype~.~.~.} Ten minutes later we had a plan.

        First we came up with an XYZ Hypothesis:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 20\textpercent{} of packaged-sushi eaters will try
          Second-Day Sushi if it's half the price of regular packaged sushi.}
        \stopnarrow

        Then we hypozoomed to the Stanford campus:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 20\textpercent{} of students buying packaged sushi at
          Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it's half the
          price of regular packaged sushi.}
        \stopnarrow

        Finally, after a
        minute of {\em pretostorming}---brainstorming about ways to pretotype
        the idea---we came up with the Relabel technique. We would create some
        labels that said, \quotation{Second-Day Sushi: 1/2 Off!}, put those labels on half
        of the boxes available for sale at the café, and then count what
        percentage of people who buy sushi for lunch decided to risk food
        poisoning and intestinal parasites to save a few bucks.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image140.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        As you can probably guess, the idea for Second-Day Sushi may have
        sounded plausible to some (in Thoughtland), but when tested in the real
        world it proved difficult to find anyone (let alone 20\textpercent{}
        of the market) willing to take the bait (sorry!). The Second-Day Sushi
        idea was dead in the water---ha!

        As you may have noticed, this example combines a Relabel pretotype with
        an Infiltrator pretotype. We are leveraging not only an existing product
        and package, but also an existing customer base and infrastructure
        (\fsp{i.e.}, the café and its lunchtime traffic). By combining multiple
        pretotyping techniques, you can dramatically reduce both the cost and
        the time it takes to run your experiments. In the pages that follow, you
        will see several additional examples of pretotyping combinations. And
        speaking of pages~.~.~.

        \subsection{Example: Book Covers}

        You can't judge a book by its cover, but you can get some market data
        from it. My friend Mike---not his real name, his real name is Steve---is
        an avid collector and disseminator of (mostly bad) computer-programming
        jokes. His collection includes such pearls as: \quotation{What do you call a
        programmer from Finland?
        Nerdic.} (And you
        thought my puns were lame.)

        Since I've known him, Mike has been talking about putting together a
        book of such jokes. He's convinced that many programmers would buy it:
        \quotation{Dude, I'd sell a ton of them. It would be the perfect gift for geeks.}
        He also thinks he has the perfect title for it: {\em 100000000
        Programming Jokes.} (100000000 is the number 256 written in binary code.
        Get it? If not, don't worry. I can guarantee you're not missing much.)

        Once again, the idea sounds plausible, and I am sure he would sell some,
        but how many? Could he sell enough to justify the effort and expense to
        produce the book? With pretotyping, he could get some YODA to answer
        those questions, and a Relabel pretotype combined with an Infiltrator
        would work extremely well in this case.

        First we have to translate his fuzzy Market Engagement Hypothesis into
        an XYZ Hypothesis. Time to \quotation{say it with numbers.} Mike thinks that \quotation{most
        programmers will buy the book,} but when we translate \quotation{most} into a
        number we get \quotation{at least 50\textpercent{}}---and even Mike realizes
        that that sounds a bit too optimistic. Eventually, he settles on a more
        realistic number, and we converge on the following XYZ Hypothesis:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 5\textpercent{} of programmers will buy {\em 100000000
          Programming Jokes} for themselves or their friends at \textdollar{}9.95.}
        \stopnarrow

        Then we hypozoom to an xyz hypothesis we can test with the help of a
        local bookstore (yes, a few still exist):

        \startnarrow
          {\bf At least 25\textpercent{} of programmers browsing for computer
          science and programming books at Books \fsp{Inc.} in Mountain View who see a
          book titled {\em 100000000 Programming Jokes} on the shelf will pick it
          up and examine it.}
        \stopnarrow

        If the XYZ
        Hypothesis is correct, then our xyz experiment should reflect it. In
        other words, if at least 25\textpercent{} of the people who see the
        book cover while browsing the computer programming section pick it up
        and check it out, it's plausible that one out of five of them would buy
        it---if it were an actual book of jokes. We can test the hypothesis by
        relabeling an existing book with a realistic-looking {\em 100000000
        Programming Jokes} cover, putting that book on the shelf, and then
        counting how many people who see the title pick it up.

        Once they open the book, of course, they will realize that you truly
        can't judge a book by the cover. But at that point, Mike can swoop in,
        explain the experiment, apologize for the little trick, and give them a
        small gift to make up for it (perhaps a sample page from the book with
        ten of his jokes). Or he can explain that the book is not ready yet, but
        if they give him their email address (some skin in the game), he'd be
        happy to send them a copy. If the data from a few experiments like this
        confirms his hypothesis, Mike can begin working on a proper book.

        Of course, you can do a similar test online (and you probably should do
        that to confirm the brick-and-mortar store results), but it's so much
        fun to do some of these experiments in person. Just remember to keep it
        legal and ethical---and be generous with the people who provide you with
        YODA.

        \section{Pretotyping Variations and Combinations}

        I've had fun collecting and sharing what I believe are compelling
        examples of pretotyping techniques and assigning them memorable names.
        But I want to emphasize that the list of pretotypes I've shared with you
        is by no means exhaustive; think of it as just
        a few examples of
        the {\em pretotyping mindset} at work. Consider it a source of
        inspiration for coming up with {\em your own} pretotyping techniques,
        variations on the existing techniques, or combinations of two or more
        techniques. You've already seen me do this: the Second-Day Sushi example
        combined an Infiltrator pretotype with a Relabel pretotype. But let me
        share with you two more examples.

        \subsection{Example: The Live Demo Pretotype}

        Instead of using an online video to help the audience visualize and
        understand the potential of a not-yet-functional product in action (as
        you would with a YouTube pretotype), you put on a demonstration in front
        of a live audience---as they used to do in markets in the days before
        television and way before YouTube.

        Let's assume that you have an idea for an app to help students relax and
        focus, so they are in a better mental state for studying and for test
        taking. You have done enough research and experiments on yourself and
        your friends to convince you that such an app would work. But before you
        invest weeks or months in properly developing, testing, publishing, and
        marketing it, you want to know what percentage of people in your target
        market would be willing to pay \textdollar{}5 for it. You go through the steps with
        which you are familiar (\fsp{i.e.}, Market Engagement Hypothesis \char"2192{} XYZ
        Hypothesis \char"2192{}~.~.~.) until you have a neatly hypozoomed xyz hypothesis you
        can test right away, something like this:

        \startnarrow
          {\bf 10\textpercent{} of Stanford students going to the campus
          bookstore at lunchtime today who stop to watch a three-minute
          demonstration of the Relax, Focus & Study app will give us their
          stanford.edu email address to be notified when our app is launched.}
        \stopnarrow

        You set up a table
        and chair near the bookstore and put on a little show:

        \startnarrow
          {\em Come gather around to see the amazing power of our Relax, Focus &
          Study app. By using a combination of scientifically proven visual and
          audio cues, our app will turn your smartphone into an amazing tool to
          reduce anxiety and induce a state of relaxed focus, ideal for studying,
          in as little as two minutes. My partner Lisa, sitting here, is connected
          to a heart-rate and blood-pressure monitor. As you can see, right now
          Lisa's high heart rate and blood pressure indicate that she's in a state
          of mild stress---no surprise with all of you strangers staring at her.
          But watch what happens as Lisa puts on her earbuds, starts the Relax,
          Focus & Study app, and concentrates on the screen. Wait for it~.~.~.
          Wait for it~.~.~. There! Her heart rate has begun to drop along with her
          blood pressure. And it continues to drop~.~.~.}
        \stopnarrow

        You get the idea.

        At the end of the demonstration, you tell the students in the audience
        that the app is not yet ready for launch, but if they go to
        RelaxFocusAndStudyApp.com and enter their stanford.edu email address
        (not some throwaway email account like myantispamemail@hotmail.com),
        they will be able to buy the app for \textdollar{}1 instead of \textdollar{}5 when it
        launches. Or if you have enough chutzpah, you can try to collect the \textdollar{}1
        at that time---even more skin in the game---provided you are prepared to
        refund the money if necessary. Of course, for the demonstration, you
        don't need to have a working version of your Relax, Focus & Study app;
        just find a video with music that helps Lisa relax and use that for now.

        \subsection{Example: The Morsel Pretotype}

        We've already used a Fake Door pretotype to validate the market interest
        for a nonfiction book on squirrel watching and a Relabel pretotype to
        test a novelty book of nerdy jokes. But let's assume that you are
        thinking of writing something a bit more ambitious and literary in
        nature, like a novel. In addition to being written in good-enough prose,
        to be successful a work of fiction must engage the readers with an
        interesting story and great characters.

        Most authors, like most entrepreneurs and inventors, believe that their
        idea for a story and their characters will be as captivating to the
        market as they are to them. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The
        Beast of Failure has a taste for ink, and most books (especially novels)
        fail in the market. Even if you could persuade a literary agent or a
        publisher to read your masterpiece, their decision (which is usually a
        rejection) will be based on their expert opinion and understanding of
        the market---and we know how that plays out. Some of the most successful
        novels in history, from {\em Harry Potter} to {\em Moby Dick}, were
        originally rejected by scores of publishers.

        So what are fiction authors or publishers to do to maximize the chances
        that a book will be successful? They should pretotype the book by
        writing a few sample chapters, expose those chapters to a subset of
        their target audience, and collect some YODA. In other words, give the
        market a few free morsels of your yet-to-be-completed work and then ask
        for some skin in the game in exchange for more.

        There are many ways to do this, but my favorite example these days comes
        from Andy Weir, author of the novel {\em The Martian}, a story about an
        astronaut marooned on Mars. A software
        engineer by trade,
        Weir enjoyed writing science fiction as a hobby but, like most aspiring
        writers, he experienced nothing but rejection after rejection from
        literary agents and publishers. Frustrated, he decided to post chapters
        from {\em The Martian} as a free serial on his website. A growing number
        of people came back week after week to read what happened to the
        marooned astronaut. Eventually, he had thousands of online fans who not
        only read the chapters, but volunteered their time to edit, fact-check,
        and suggest ideas for the book---all examples of skin in the game and a
        great initial indicator of market engagement.

        But the story gets even better. At the request of some of his fans, Weir
        published the novel on Amazon as a Kindle e-book. He wanted to make it
        available for free, but was forced to ask for a little bit of skin in
        the game since the minimum price Amazon would allow was 99\textcent{}. In three
        months, he sold over 30,000 copies---enough to qualify as a
        science-fiction bestseller on Amazon's ranking. With that kind of YODA,
        you don't need to knock on agents' or publishers' doors; they come
        knocking on yours. In a matter of weeks, Weir had an agent, a publisher,
        and an offer from a major studio to turn the book into a motion picture.
        Both the book and the movie were spectacularly successful. {\em The
        Martian} was The Right It.

        \section{What Makes a Pretotype a Pretotype}

        As you have seen, pretotypes can take many forms. But to be worthy of
        the name, a pretotype must satisfy three key requirements:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            A pretotype must produce YODA with skin in the game.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A pretotype can be implemented quickly.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A pretotype can be implemented cheaply.
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        But even if you
        stick to these requirements, you will have a large number of pretotyping
        techniques and combinations to choose from. Which raises a few
        questions:

        \startnarrow
          {\em How do you choose which pretotypes to use?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em How many different experiments do you need to run?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em How much data do you need to collect?}
        \stopnarrow

        \startnarrow
          {\em When can you stop testing?}
        \stopnarrow

        To help you answer those questions, you need a final set of tools,
        analysis tools, which are the focus of the next chapter.
      \stopchapter

      \startchapter[title={Analysis Tools},reference=chapter:6]
        You have learned how thinking tools, like the XYZ Hypothesis and
        hypozooming, help you transform a fuzzy and poorly articulated idea into
        a clear, objective, and testable set of hypotheses. You have also
        learned how pretotyping tools, like the Mechanical Turk or the Fake
        Door, make it possible for you to collect data about your idea by
        testing those hypotheses quickly and inexpensively. Now you will learn
        how analysis tools can help you make sense of the data you collect, so
        you can make that important transition from data to decision.

        \section{The Skin-in-the-Game Caliper}

        I've already introduced and casually used the term {\em skin in the
        game} a number of times. Now it's time for a more thorough introduction
        and discussion of this key concept along with examples of how to put it
        into practical use.\footnote{I highly recommend
        Nassim Nicholas Taleb's {\em Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in
        Daily Life} (New York: Random House, 2018) for a broader and more
        in-depth discussion and analysis of this important concept.}

        It's not clear who
        is responsible for coining the term {\em skin in the game}. Some people
        attribute it to legendary investor Warren Buffett; others have found no
        evidence to support that claim. For the longest time, I thought it was a
        phrase used by fur trappers playing poker and betting animal skins
        instead of dollars. (Not a bad guess given that the slang term {\em
        bucks}---as in dollars---comes from {\em buckskins}, which were
        considered a form of currency at some point.) Despite a lack of
        consensus about the origins of the term, most people agree on its
        meaning. Generally speaking, in the expression {\em skin in the game},
        the word {\em game} is a metaphor for some activity with a possibility
        of winning or losing, and {\em skin} is a metaphor for having something
        of value at risk in that game (\fsp{e.g.}, money, time, or reputation). In the
        context of this book, the {\em game} consists of bringing a new idea
        into the market, and winning or losing is determined by whether that new
        idea succeeds or fails in that market.

        Unlike games such as chess or football, our game is not a zero-sum game:
        one new product's loss (market failure) does not necessarily mean that
        another, similar product will win (market success). It is also extremely
        rare for any one product to capture 100\textpercent{} or even
        90\textpercent{} of any one market and continue to dominate that
        market for decades. In other words, it's a tough game to win and, as
        we've seen, most people lose at it most of the time. If you lose (your
        idea fails in the market), you lose all or most of your investment
        (skin). But if you win (your idea succeeds in the market), you get your
        investment (skin) back along with a few---and sometimes a lot of---extra
        pelts. And it's those extra pelts that make the game and its risks
        worthwhile and fun for many of us.

        Entrepreneurs, inventors, and investors in a new idea automatically have
        skin in the game and typically lots of it. If Mark quits his good job,
        takes on a second mortgage, and works eighty
        hours a week to
        start a new business, he's putting all kinds of skin in the game,
        including money (giving up a salary, taking on a loan) and time (eighty
        hours a week)---he's risking a lot.

        When Mary convinces her company to invest in her new invention to let
        her lead its development, she may not be using her own money and the
        company is paying for her time, but she's investing (and risking) her
        reputation, future promotions, and earning potential if the invention
        fails to meet the expectations she set for the company. When venture
        capitalists or angel investors decide to invest in an idea, they are
        investing and risking not only money and time, but also their reputation
        in the VC community.

        As an entrepreneur, inventor, or an investor in a new idea, you have no
        choice but to have some and often a lot of skin in the game. Everyone
        knows and expects this---and it's the way it should be. Having skin in
        the game means that you have something at risk, something significant to
        gain or lose, depending on the outcome. This skin is an indication that
        you are serious about the idea, that you have done your homework, and
        that you will deal with challenges as they arise rather than abandoning
        your idea at the first sign of trouble. Skin in the game indicates
        commitment, seriousness, and thoughtfulness.

        But make sure that you don't put too much skin in the game to develop an
        idea unless and until you can demonstrate that the market is interested
        enough in the idea to put up some skins themselves. Not opinions, not
        predictions, but skin!

        Until and unless individuals put some of their own skin in the game, you
        can't count those people as likely customers or users. Rather, they are
        merely spectators---they've got nothing to lose. Heck, they might even
        enjoy watching you and your idea crash and burn.

        When it comes to gauging an idea's market potential and
        likelihood of
        success, our deliberation must be based on hard data, and the data must
        come with some skin in the game. I'll say it again, because this is so
        important: {\em before you put a lot of skin in the game on your idea,
        make sure you can get some skin in the game from your target market.}

        But what qualifies as skin in the game from your target market? And how
        much of it do you need?

        To help you answer those important questions, I've developed a
        Skin-in-the-Game Caliper that you can use to assign skin-in-the-game
        \quotation{points} to different types of target market responses. The caliper can
        be customized for specific products and markets.

        \subsection{Example: The Tortell-o-matic}

        Let's assume that my idea is the Tortell-o-matic, a \textdollar{}250 automated
        tortellini maker for the home. Fill the Tortell-o-matic with flour,
        water, eggs, salt, and your choice of filling, and two minutes later
        this amazing machine starts to pop out perfectly shaped, freshly made
        tortellini. Yum!

        In Thoughtland (and tummyland) the Tortell-o-matic scores great. Many of
        my friends and colleagues love the idea and say that they would
        definitely buy a Tortell-o-matic for their home (yeah, right!).
        Unfortunately, designing, developing, and manufacturing the
        Tortell-o-matic will require a big investment. Even a one-off prototype
        is likely to take months and cost tens of thousands of dollars. That's a
        lot of my own skin in the game. So before I undertake that investment, I
        need something more tangible than opinions and promises from my target
        market. I need to see some YODA with some of their skin in the game in
        it.

        I can use one of my favorite pretotyping techniques, the Mechanical
        Turk, to set up an experiment and collect that YODA. A dummy
        Tortell-o-matic sits on a table. Under the table and
        hidden by a
        tablecloth, an accomplice holds a bucket of premade tortellini. When I
        push a button on the nonfunctioning machine, the accomplice plays a
        recording of mechanical noises and begins to push tortellini through the
        machine. I can use this pretotype to collect YODA in a live demo, an
        online demonstration, or both.

        The question is, after people get to see the Tortell-o-matic in action,
        how do I assign skin-in-the-game points to the responses I get from the
        market? That's where a Skin-in-the-Game Caliper comes in handy. As an
        example, here's the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper for my Tortell-o-matic:

        \startplacetable
          \startxtable

        As you can see, I am
        brutally selective when it comes to assigning skin-in-the-game points.
        For example, I ignore not only random opinions, but also so-called
        expert opinions. Why? Because we know from experience that all too often
        experts don't know any better than nonexperts. For example, the people
        at Ford who came up with the idea for the Edsel, one of Ford's biggest
        commercial failures, were experts in the automotive market with many
        previous successes under their belt. Similarly, few companies have more
        expertise in developing internet products than Google, and yet Google
        failed with Google Wave, Google Buzz, and many other internet-based
        ideas. At the same time, many ideas that experts considered to be
        hopeless turned out to be huge successes. Author J. K. Rowling, for
        example, received many rejections by the world's most experienced
        publishing houses before an editor took a chance on the first {\em Harry
        Potter} book. That's why opinions---of any kind and from anyone---rate a
        zero on the caliper.

        I also assign zero points to online likes, thumbs-ups, thumbs-downs,
        tweets, retweets, comments on social media, polls, and surveys of all
        types. It's too easy to mindlessly click on a like, make a comment, or
        write a tweet. No skin = no points.

        The smallest piece of evidence I consider data in this example is a {\em
        validated} email address given willingly to you by its owner with the
        understanding that it will be used to contact the person for offers,
        updates, or information about your specific product idea. By validated,
        I mean that it must be a bona fide email account that the person
        actually checks and uses regularly, not the kind of throwaway email
        address people often give when they are forced to do so. Based on my
        experience (and probably your own) most people are protective of their
        main email address and cautious about whom they give it to, which means
        it has some value to
        them. Because of that, I consider a validated email address---as long as
        it's knowingly and
        willingly\footnote{You should assign no
        value at all to the kind of email addresses that you collect (or buy)
        without the owner's explicit consent and for the purpose of spamming
        (\fsp{e.g.}, \quotation{Get 100,000 email addresses for only \textdollar{}39.99}).} given to
        you for the purposes of being informed about your specific product---to
        be skin in the game, but the very smallest possible unit of it: 1 point.

        A validated phone number, on the other hand, I value at 10 points. Why
        so much more than an email address? Because most people are at least an
        order of magnitude more protective and careful about sharing their phone
        number than they are about sharing their email address.

        I value a person's time at 1 point per minute. If someone is willing to
        invest 30 minutes to listen to a new product presentation, they get 30
        points of skin in the game, because it's a reliable indication that they
        have a bona fide interest in the product.

        Finally, we come to the ultimate type of skin in the game:
        buckskin---good ol' money. As the saying goes, \quotation{Money talks, opinion
        walks.} All right, that's not exactly how the saying goes. I've taken
        the liberty of replacing bovine dung with something even less appealing
        and useful: opinions. At least manure can be used as fertilizer. When it
        comes to money, I keep things simple: \textdollar{}1 counts for 1 skin-in-the-game
        point.

        Feel free to substitute your local currency and adjust accordingly for
        your own idea or market, but don't try to be too precise (\fsp{e.g.}, an email
        is worth .4 points and a phone number 3.7). Instead, think in terms of
        orders of magnitude (\fsp{e.g.}, 1, 10, 100) and use your intuition and
        experience to guide you in making those determinations. The distinction
        and clear separation between no skin (zero points) and skin is far more
        important than being precise with the points. Just make sure you are
        honest, objective,
        and reasonable in
        assigning relative values: for example, a \textdollar{}50 deposit should count much
        more than a validated email address.

        \subsection{Example: A Tale of Two Teams}

        I use the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper all the time when students or clients
        come to me with what they {\em think} is data. Here's a sample scenario.

        Imagine that two teams, Team A and Team B, come to you with two
        different opportunities to invest in a new product idea. Team A makes
        their case by showing you a flashy YouTube video demo of their future
        product in action. Then they flaunt a bunch of skinless metrics:

        {\em In one week we got 140,000 views, 20,000 thumbs-ups, and only 100
        thumbs-downs. And look at these comments: \quotation{Awesome,} \quotation{This will be
        great!} \quotation{Amazing idea}~.~.~.}

        Team B also has a video, but instead of using total views, or thumbs, or
        comments to make their case, they present their data as follows:

        {\em We made a two-minute video to demonstrate what our product does and
        spent \textdollar{}400 on online ads to draw traffic to it. In one week, our video
        was seen in its entirety by 8,000 people. At the end of the video we
        gave people an opportunity to give us their email address to be informed
        when the product will launch. We received 120 email addresses, 40 of
        which were not confirmed, so we only counted 80 as valid. A week later
        we sent a follow-up email to those 80 people giving them the opportunity
        to buy a prerelease (handmade) version of the product for \textdollar{}125 (a
        50\textpercent{} early-adopter discount), and we received 20 orders.}

        Using the above
        Skin-in-the-Game Caliper, how many points does Team A get? That's easy.
        Zero! Goose egg! To an untrained eye, the absolute numbers presented by
        Team A may be more impressive than those of Team B (\fsp{i.e.}, 140,000 views
        vs. 8,000), but they are not good YODA. Team A did not even tell us how
        much time or ad money they spent to get those 140,000 views.

        Team B, on the other hand, gave us not only numbers, but also the
        context in which to evaluate them and, most important, their YODA comes
        with some skin in the game:

        {\bf \textdollar{}400 in ads \char"2192{} 8,000 views = 0 skin-in-the-game points (no
        points for views, but an interesting first estimate for how much it will
        cost to get a view, \fsp{i.e.}, \textdollar{}0.05/view)}

        {\bf 8,000 views \char"2192{} 80 validated email addresses = 80
        skin-in-the-game points}

        {\bf 80 emails \char"2192{} 20 orders for \textdollar{}125 each = 2,500 skin-in-the-game
        points}

        It's entirely possible that Team A's idea is The Right It and that it
        will be a smashing success. They have a lot of impressive-looking
        numbers to share, but to be convinced I'd need to see real data---YODA
        with skin in the game. I'd give them a copy of this book and ask them to
        come back to me with some pelts.

        On the other hand, Team B has given me real and useful data: a \textdollar{}400
        investment in ads resulted in 80 validated email addresses (\textdollar{}5 per
        address) and \textdollar{}2,500 in orders. I would, of course, want to run a few
        more experiments (I'll show you why and how in a bit), but it's a
        promising beginning.

        All data is not created equal---even YODA. Team A focused on quantity,
        while team B focused on quality. Quality of data
        beats quantity of
        data, and there's no better indication of data quality than data that
        comes with a lot of skin in the game attached to it.

        \section{The TRI Meter}

        Collecting YODA with skin in the game to validate our Market Engagement
        Hypothesis is a necessary first step, but raw data by itself is not
        sufficient. In order to extract value out of data and use it to make
        rational and well-informed decisions, we need a way to interpret it, put
        it on a scale, compare it, and combine it with other relevant data.

        The data from a cholesterol test, for example, is just a ratio of two
        values, the number of milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood.
        Let's say you go for your annual physical exam, take a blood test, and
        learn that your total cholesterol is 300. That number by itself is not
        very meaningful, but when the doctor pulls out a chart and shows you
        that, statistically speaking, people with a cholesterol level of 300 are
        4.5 times as likely to die of heart disease than those with a
        cholesterol level of 200, you may decide to lay off cheeseburgers for a
        while.

        The Right It Meter, TRI Meter for short, is a visual analysis tool I
        developed to help you interpret the YODA you've collected as objectively
        as possible. More precisely, the TRI Meter is a gauge to help you
        estimate how likely it is that an idea will succeed in the market, but
        it's a gauge that is not too technical, complicated, or
        confusing---which can easily happen whenever probability and statistics
        are involved.

        First let me show you what the TRI Meter looks like in action. Then I
        will explain how to use and interpret it. The image
        below shows a TRI
        Meter after four pretotyping experiments (represented by the four white
        arrows on the right). As you can see, the TRI Meter scale is partitioned
        into five likelihood-of-success categories ranging from Very Unlikely
        (10\textpercent{} chance of success) to Very Likely
        (90\textpercent{} chance of success), each representing the likelihood
        that your idea is The Right It.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image159.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        Why only five categories and not seven or ten? I've debated whether to
        add more categories (\fsp{e.g.}, Extremely Unlikely and Extremely Likely), but
        that would only add complexity and suggest greater precision than our
        experimental tools and subjects (\fsp{i.e.}, people) can provide. It would
        also bring us uncomfortably close to a feeling of certainty in an
        environment in which there are no guarantees. That's why the scale goes
        from 10\textpercent{} to 90\textpercent{} in broad
        20\textpercent{} increments instead of 0\textpercent{} to
        100\textpercent{} with finer increments. I am a big fan of \quotation{say it
        with numbers,} but asking for too much precision or too much confidence
        in these kinds of
        predictions reminds
        me of the following lines from Dr. Seuss's wonderful 1990 book {\em Oh,
        the Places You'll Go}:

        {\em And will you succeed?}

        {\em Yes! You will indeed}

        {\em 98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.}

        Those lines always bring a smile to my face. Unfortunately, I can't give
        you anything as precise as that 98 and 3/4 percent guarantee---nobody
        (with the possible exception of Dr. Seuss) can. And I am pretty sure
        that the good doctor himself could not have predicted that {\em Oh, the
        Places You'll Go} would sell over 5 million copies and still be a
        bestseller two decades later---talk about a book that is The Right It.

        If you are working in physics or chemistry, and your instruments are
        precise enough, a measured difference between, say, 62.7\textpercent{}
        and 63.3\textpercent{} may be both accurate and relevant. But here we
        are dealing with the behaviors of markets and people, which are much
        harder to quantify. However, if you properly apply the tools and
        techniques I've been sharing with you, you will significantly increase
        your chances of success---80ish percent guaranteed!

        Now about the arrows in the diagram. That big, ominous black arrow at
        the bottom labeled \quotation{The Law of Market Failure} points to Very Unlikely.
        That arrow is there to remind us of the hard fact that most new ideas
        will fail in the market. It's there to help us make sure that we run
        enough experiments and collect enough YODA to counteract the dismal
        initial odds for success predicted by the Law of Market Failure. Let me
        use an analogy to illustrate this important point.

        In US criminal courts, a defendant is considered innocent until proven
        guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Not only that, but the burden of proof
        falls on the prosecution. In a criminal trial,
        a defendant does not
        have to prove his or her innocence; it's the prosecution that has to
        provide enough convincing evidence to prove guilt. But when we move from
        criminal law to the law of the market to put an idea on trial, we begin
        with a presumption that our idea is \quotation{guilty} of being The Wrong
        It---that it will fail in the market. It is our job to provide enough
        hard evidence to swing the jury in favor of the idea.

        In a similar vein, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized the phrase
        \quotation{Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.} Products that are
        The Right It are not exactly {\em extraordinary} (there are too many of
        them), but they are the exception rather than the rule. So perhaps our
        motto should be: \quotation{Exceptional claims require sufficient evidence to
        support the exception.} The only evidence that our court will allow is
        YODA with skin in the game. And the only way we can get that YODA is by
        running pretotyping experiments. Which brings me to the other arrows.

        Each of the smaller, light-colored arrows to the right of the scale
        represents a separate pretotyping experiment and how that experiment
        maps onto a specific likelihood of success. To perform that mapping, you
        have to determine if and how well the data you collected from an
        experiment corroborates (\fsp{i.e.}, supports) your hypotheses. One way you
        can do this is by asking the following question after you've run an
        experiment and collected data from it:

        If this idea is destined to succeed in the market, assuming that it is
        competently executed, how likely is it that this particular pretotyping
        experiment would have produced this result?

        Remember that a pretotyping experiment is designed to test
        a specific xyz
        hypothesis, which is derived from a Market Engagement Hypothesis. So
        what you are really asking is this:

        If our MEH is true, how likely is it that this pretotyping experiment
        would generate this data?

        Here's a guideline to help you map your answer on the TRI Meter:

        If the data {\bf significantly exceeds} what the hypothesis predicts,
        you point the arrow to {\bf Very Likely.}

        If the data {\bf meets or slightly exceeds} what the hypothesis
        predicts, you point the arrow to {\bf Likely.}

        If the data {\bf falls a bit short} of what the hypothesis predicts, you
        point the arrow to {\bf Unlikely.}

        If the data {\bf falls really short} of what the hypothesis predicts,
        you point the arrow to {\bf Very Unlikely.}

        Finally, if the data is for some reason {\bf ambiguous, potentially
        corrupted, or hard to interpret,} you point the arrow to {\bf 50/50} or
        optionally discard it. After all, even in science not all experiments
        produce clean and reliable data.

        \subsection{Example: Second-Day Sushi}

        All of this sounds more complicated than it actually is, so let me show
        you how to use the TRI Meter on our Second-Day Sushi example, which,
        unlike the fish itself, should still be fresh in your mind. First, we
        have to make sure that we have an XYZ Hypothesis that we can hypozoom
        into a set of xyz hypotheses.

        If you recall, we had the following XYZ Hypothesis for Second-Day Sushi:

        {\bf At least
        20\textpercent{} of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day Sushi if
        it's half the price of regular packaged sushi.}

        And from that, we hypozoomed to our first xyz hypothesis:

        {\bf At least 20\textpercent{} of students buying packaged sushi at
        Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it's half the
        price of regular packaged sushi.}

        To test the first xyz hypothesis, we came up with a Relabel pretotype:
        stick a label that says \quotation{Second-Day Sushi: 1/2 Off} on half of the boxes
        on display and count how many people choose to buy them. Let's assume
        that 100 boxes of sushi are on display and that we label half of them
        (50 boxes) as Second-Day Sushi. The key piece of data we need to collect
        is the percentage of Second-Day Sushi boxes sold compared to the total
        number of sushi boxes sold. In other words, how many people who wanted
        sushi for lunch chose to buy Second-Day Sushi?

        Let's assume that during lunch, students bought a total of 40 boxes of
        prepackaged sushi. How many of those boxes were the relabeled Second-Day
        Sushi? Here are a few possible scenarios:

        Here's how these
        results map on the TRI Meter:

        {\bf Outcome A (0\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} Ask yourself, \quotation{If
        Second-Day Sushi is The Right It, how likely is it that we would sell 0
        boxes out of forty?} Given that your first xyz hypothesis predicts 8
        boxes and you sold 0, this is an easy call. The arrow from that result
        should point to Very Unlikely.

        {\bf Outcome B (5\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} This result is
        not as discouraging as the previous one; after all, two people bought
        into the idea of slightly stale sushi, but it's well below the
        predictions of 20\textpercent{} from our hypothesis. Unless we are
        ready to dramatically revise our business model and expectations (\fsp{e.g.},
        target a few daring souls who are {\em really} short on cash and hungry
        for sushi), outcome B should also point to Very Unlikely.

        {\bf Outcome C (15\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} The data from
        this experiment provides evidence that some sort of viable market might
        exist, but that that market is not as big as we need it to be to make
        the business successful based on our existing hypothesis. For now, and
        unless we decide to adjust our business model and expectations
        accordingly, these data point to Unlikely.

        {\bf Outcome D (20\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} This is at the
        bottom range of our hypothesized market, but it fully meets the minimum
        requirements for confirming the hypothesis. Yay! It deserves a Likely
        rating.

        {\bf Outcome E (40\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} Whoa! This
        result blows our prediction out of the water. If we ask, \quotation{If Second-Day
        Sushi is The Right It, how likely is it that we would sell 16 boxes out
        of forty?} we can confidently answer Very Likely.

        {\bf Outcome F
        (5\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} This is a discouraging result,
        but the data is questionable because, by an unlucky coincidence, the
        school's daily paper had a front-page article on the risks of eating raw
        fish. Because of that, we either point the arrow to 50/50 (inconclusive)
        or discard it.

        {\bf Outcome G (75\textpercent{} of all boxes sold):} This is a
        fantastic result, but we have to be objective, so we cannot ignore the
        fact that on the day of the experiment an unusually high number of
        high-school students on a college tour from Japan visited the café.
        Perhaps these young students did not fully understand the implication of
        the Second-Day Sushi name, or perhaps they did not have a lot of money
        for lunch. Either way, since this was not a normal situation, we should
        probably dismiss this particular result. As much as we'd like to believe
        that our idea is the greatest ever, we have to be careful not to fool
        ourselves.

        \subsection{How Much Data Do You Need?}

        After you understand the TRI Meter scale and know how to map data we
        collect into the likelihood of success, you need to answer an important
        question: How much data is enough data? First of all, let me be clear
        and tell you that a single experiment will not do, no matter how
        decisive or conclusive you think the results from it are.

        Think about it this way. If, using the above example, our first
        experiment results in outcome A (0\textpercent{}), do we then give up
        on the idea? Or if it results in outcome E (40\textpercent{})---twice
        as good as we expected---do we drop everything and dedicate ourselves
        full-time to Second-Day Sushi? Before you answer, consider a couple of
        examples of other types of important decisions:

        Would you propose
        marriage or accept a marriage proposal after a single date? Hopefully
        not, even if that one date was {\em the perfect date.} Those first few
        hours together might be a promising indication that you may have found
        your Mr. Right or Ms. Right. But, just like The Right It, the Right Him
        or the Right Her are the exception and not the rule, so the smart thing
        is to confirm that initial result with more dates.

        If you were interviewing a potential candidate for a job in your
        organization, would you ask just one question and make a final hiring
        decision based on that one answer?

        {\em \quotation{How many Ping-Pong balls can you fit in a school bus?}}

        {\em \quotation{Ahem~.~.~. I am not sure~.~.~. 100,000?}}

        {\em \quotation{Wrong! Not even close. You are clearly not Pong Industries, \fsp{Inc.},
        material. Thank you for coming and good luck with your job search. The
        door is that way.}}

        A single pretotyping experiment is not enough to reliably determine
        whether or not our idea is likely to succeed---even if the results from
        that one experiment are clear and compelling. Why? Because many possible
        factors can skew an experiment. We can discount or discard some results
        if we are aware of factors that may have tainted them (\fsp{e.g.}, the scary
        news article about sushi safety or the spike in Japanese visitors in our
        Second-Day Sushi example), but we can't possibly know or account for all
        possible ways that our data may be skewed or corrupted.

        A total novice at archery may hit the bull's-eye on the first-ever shot,
        while an experienced archer may miss badly once in a while. That's why
        you need several arrows on the sample TRI Meter.

        In order to have
        confidence in your results, you need to run multiple pretotyping
        experiments and validate multiple xyz hypotheses. How many experiments
        do you need to run? That's like asking how many dates you should go on
        with someone before you propose or agree to marry that person, or how
        many interview questions you should ask a candidate for an important job
        before extending an offer. The answer to such questions depends on a
        number of factors (how well those dates went, how critical the position
        you are trying to fill is, \fsp{etc.}), but the number of dates (or questions)
        should be more than one or two---wouldn't you agree?

        Similarly, when it comes to pretotyping, the answer depends on a number
        of factors, such as:

        How much are you planning to invest in the idea?

        How much time or money can you afford to lose if it doesn't work out?

        How much certainty do you need before making a decision?

        Are the results from the experiments you've run so far conclusive or
        inconclusive?

        As a rule of thumb, I'd say you need to design and run a {\em bare
        minimum} of three to five experiments---and several more if executing
        the idea involves a significant risk (\fsp{e.g.}, quitting your job or
        \quotation{betting the company}) or a major investment. The number of experiments
        should be commensurate with the investment and the consequences of
        failure---the amount of your skin in the game.

        \subsection{Interpreting the TRI Meter}

        Now that you know how to map YODA from individual experiments on the TRI
        Meter, I will show you how to interpret the
        overall results and
        decide on the next steps. To help me do that, I will use a sample
        scenario that follows a typical journey from an initial version of an
        idea to The Right It. Put on your boxing gloves and mouth guard, because
        we are about to enter the ring and go for a few rounds with the Beast of
        Failure.

        \subsubsection{Round 1: Punched in the Face}

        Let's begin with the most common scenario. Unless you get lucky, after a
        couple of experiments the TRI Meter for the first iteration of your idea
        (Idea 1) will look something like this:

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image168.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        If you are new at this, those first punches are going to surprise, hurt,
        and disorient you. But don't let this kind of result demoralize or
        discourage you.

        First of all, welcome to the club! What club? The very crowded club of
        people who thought that their idea was for sure---no doubt about
        it---The Right It, only to have their hopes and expectations mercilessly
        dashed by the Beast of Failure.

        Second, think how
        much worse off you'd be if you had gone ahead with that idea without
        testing it. After investing months of work and lots of money to develop
        and market your product, you find out that your idea was The Wrong It
        all along---a knockout punch that sends you to the hospital.
        Fortunately, our thinking, pretotyping, and analysis tools can help you
        avoid that. A little pain now can save you tons of pain later. By
        learning quickly and cheaply that a particular idea is not likely to be
        successful, you will have plenty of time and resources left to modify
        your original idea or explore a new set of ideas---to go a few more
        rounds.

        Based on this TRI Meter, we should concede that our beloved new product
        idea is most likely headed for failure in the market. Round 1 goes to
        the Beast of Failure. If you are really passionate about your new
        product, you may decide to get back into the ring and run a few more
        experiments with the same exact idea---just to be sure. But a more
        logical and less painful course of action would be to go back to the
        drawing board (or back to your corner, if you like the boxing metaphor)
        and use what you've learned from your experiment to tweak your idea.

        \subsubsection{Rounds 2--4: We Take Some, We Give Some}

        We make some tweaks to our original idea (Idea 1) and run some tests
        with each of the variations (Ideas 2, 3, and 4). When we map the results
        on the TRI Meter we get the \quotation{Likelihood of Success} shown below.

        We still get punched quite a bit---especially with Idea 2---but not as
        hard as before. Our tweaked versions of the idea manage to stay out of
        the Very Unlikely zone, and we even manage to land a punch with the
        fourth version of our idea (Idea 4). That's a very good sign---we are
        learning more about the market, tweaking accordingly, and moving closer
        to The Right It territory.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image170a.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        \subsubsection{Round 5: We Land a Few Good Punches}

        Using Idea 4 (the one that scored a Likely) as the starting point, we
        make a couple of additional tweaks and go back into the ring with Idea
        5.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image170b.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        The arrows from our
        three experiments with the fifth version of our idea all point to Likely
        or Very Likely. This is great! Assuming that the experiments that
        produced those results were properly designed and run and that the data
        from each was interpreted fairly and objectively, there's strong
        evidence that this idea might be The Right It. But that ominous black
        arrow at the bottom does its job and reminds us how rare it is for a new
        idea to succeed in the market. Are those three positive results enough
        to balance and counteract the Law of Market Failure?

        Developing this particular idea will require a major investment and
        commitment, and we want a higher degree of confidence before going
        ahead. So we decide to run three more experiments using Idea 5.

        We map the new results on the TRI Meter alongside the first set of
        results (second set of results shown in {\bf bold}), and we get the
        following:

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image171.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        All right! The new set of experiments on Idea 5 confirms the first set
        of results. This is great. We can't completely ignore the
        big black
        arrow---the market may still surprise us with an unexpected punch---but
        there's a good chance that the fifth iteration of our idea is The Right
        It.

        To help you visualize the process, here's what our sequence of tweaks
        and experiments looks like if we chart them all (from Idea 1 to Idea 5)
        on a single TRI Meter:

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image172.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        We ran a total of twelve pretotyping experiments on five different ideas
        (or versions of a similar idea). That may sound like a lot of tweaking
        and experimenting, but with pretotyping this would not have taken more
        than a couple of weeks---less time than what most teams would spend to
        write an OPD-based business plan.

        As we wrap up our discussion of the TRI Meter, let me repeat that only
        arrows that represent actual data from carefully designed and personally
        conducted experiments are allowed. No opinions and no OPD (market
        research done by other people, with other methods, at other times---you
        know the drill). Your arrows must consist of only YODA with skin in the
        game.

      \startchapter[title={Tactics Toolkit},reference=chapter:7]
        In \in{Part}[part:2], I introduced you to a set
        of tools to add clarity to the way you {\em think} about your idea,
        accelerate the way you collect data to {\em validate} your idea, and add
        structure and objectivity to the way you {\em analyze and interpret} the
        data you collect. It's a powerful toolkit, with many tools to choose
        from, different ways to use them, and countless ways to combine them.
        But how do you decide which tools to use, how to use them, and when to
        use them? That's what we will cover in Part III: Plastic Tactics.

        In case you are wondering, the word {\em plastic} in the title for this
        section is not a reference to Tupperware, but to {\em plasticity}---the
        ability to change and adapt one's plans and actions in response to new
        and unexpected situations. Having this ability is critical, because when
        it comes to bringing new ideas into contact with their intended market,
        plans rarely go smoothly---regardless of how diligent and careful we are
        in making those plans.

        Sticking with our boxing analogy from Part II, the best quote
        I've heard on the
        subject of planning comes from an unlikely source, boxer Mike Tyson.
        Asked to comment about one of his opponent's plans for a fight, Tyson
        replied, \quotation{Everybody has a plan until I punch them in the mouth.} Expect
        the market to punch you in the mouth a few times and be prepared to
        change your plans and tactics accordingly.

        I cannot give you a one-size-fits-all plan or a step-by-step set of
        instructions---the kind you get when you buy IKEA furniture. But I will
        share with you some of my favorite and most effective tactics to help
        you take full advantage of our tools, so you can avoid some market
        punches and perhaps punch back a few times. I will follow this chapter
        with one final example that illustrates all our tools and tactics in
        action.

        Ready? Let's go.

        \section{Tactic 1: Think Globally, Test Locally}

        If the phrase \quotation{Think globally, test locally} has a familiar ring to it,
        it's because it was inspired by the popular \quotation{Think globally, act
        locally} slogan (and bumper sticker) commonly associated with
        ecologically minded people and organizations. In our case, the objective
        is not to save the whales or protect the ozone layer, but to save our
        time and protect our valuable resources by making early contact with the
        local market instead of wasting time in Thoughtland making premature
        grandiose plans for worldwide sales and distribution of our product.

        \quotation{Think globally, test locally} means that you can have global plans for
        your product, but before you spend any time developing and executing
        those ambitious international plans, you should
        validate your idea
        on a much smaller and easier-to-reach subset of your target market. Make
        that initial market your town, your neighborhood, your workplace, or
        your school. The closer and more easily accessible it is, the better.

        Go ahead and spend a few minutes daydreaming that your unique idea for a
        pizza restaurant will become the next California Pizza Kitchen---a chain
        with hundreds of locations in several countries. But don't waste time
        making plans for global-market conquest until you have achieved
        consistent success with one location.

        The words {\em globally} and {\em locally} suggest geography, but the
        \quotation{test locally} principle applies to more than just physical distance or
        geographic regions. It applies to any market with multiple conceptual
        groupings or industry standards, each of which requires additional
        investment to reach and address. If your market is smartphone users, for
        example, where those users physically live is less important than what
        smartphone platform they use (\fsp{e.g.}, Apple iOS, Google Android). Many
        mobile app developers double or triple their up-front investment and
        waste months of engineering and marketing time to develop and launch
        their new app on multiple mobile platforms at the same time---only to
        learn that Google Android users are just as uninterested in their app as
        Apple iOS users. Validate your idea on one platform at first---the one
        that is technically or conceptually closest to you---before you set out
        to conquer the rest.

        If you are a mobile app developer and you are most comfortable and
        experienced with the Google Android operating system, then that's your
        local \quotation{neighborhood.} Android users thousands of miles away are easier
        for you to reach than iOS users living next door. So begin by
        pretotyping and testing your
        new app idea on the
        Android market. If your pretotyping experiments indicate that the app is
        likely to be successful with those users, then you can start thinking
        about developing versions for other platforms.

        Early in my career, blinded by dreams of global success, I consistently
        ignored the \quotation{test locally} tactic and ended up paying a hefty price for
        it. In one of the companies I cofounded, for example, we hired sales
        teams to cover Europe and Asia Pacific before we had achieved consistent
        and repeatable sales success and user adoption in the US. To support
        each new country, we had to translate, customize, and test multiple
        versions of our product and documentation for that country. All of this
        cost us a lot of time and money and was a huge distraction. I can't
        blame the company's eventual failure on that one decision, but it
        certainly did not help.

        But what if there is no local market for your idea? What if you live,
        say, in Montana, and your idea is solar-powered surfboards? In that
        case, I suggest that you move to southern California or Hawaii, look for
        a new idea, or come up with creative ways to bridge that distance (\fsp{e.g.},
        partner with someone who has ready access to surfers).

        \quotation{Test locally} is one of my favorite tactics, because it's the best way
        to quickly get yourself and your idea out of Thoughtland and into
        contact with the market. With this tactic, we take hypozooming and go a
        step further. We don't just zoom into a small test market, we zoom into
        a small {\em and local} test market.

        Remember how in the Relabel pretotype example for Second-Day Sushi we
        zoomed in all the way to within a few hundred feet of our current
        location? Not just California, not just Palo Alto, not even just
        Stanford University, but to the very same building where the students
        were at the time. By doing that, we were able
        to come up with a
        pretotyping experiment that we could execute easily and right away.

        \subsection{Say It with Numbers: Distance to Data}

        You can---and should---measure how well you are following the \quotation{think
        globally, test locally} tactic by calculating your {\em Distance to
        Data} (or DTD). If you plan to collect your data in the physical world
        (\fsp{e.g.}, at a store, on a street corner, or in a club meeting), you can
        measure DTD using your favorite unit for distance (\fsp{e.g.}, meters, miles,
        furlongs) and then try to minimize it. By keeping initial
        market-validation efforts as local as possible, you save valuable time
        and money, which allows you to run more experiments or test more ideas.
        You'll be surprised how much good YODA is often available right in your
        neighborhood or other nearby areas. Let me give you an example.

        Linda has an idea for a \textdollar{}19 device to make those visits to the coin
        laundry more efficient---and less depressing. She calls her gizmo
        LaundroDone. Toss LaundroDone into the washing machine or dryer along
        with your clothes, and when the machine completes the cycle and stops
        spinning, the device sends a text to your phone to let you know that
        your clothes are ready. Thanks to LaundroDone, Linda explains, she
        doesn't have to wait around at the coin laundry, sitting on plastic
        chairs and fending off romantic advances by pajama-wearing Romeos down
        to their last pair of (hopefully) clean underwear. She can escape the
        depressing glare of those fluorescent lights and the nauseating
        potpourri of odors from detergent and fabric softeners. Thanks to the
        LaundroDone, she can wait in the safety and comfort of her car,
        listening to Coldplay, until she gets the alert that her clothes are
        ready.

        Linda comes up with a brilliant way to test her idea using a combination
        Mechanical Turk and Facade pretotypes, and she
        is eager to put it
        into action and collect her first YODA. She believes that the best
        market for her idea is large coin laundries in major metropolitan areas
        (big cities like New York or Los Angeles), and that's where she wants to
        run her tests.

        But Linda lives in a tiny residential community in rural southern
        California. There's only one coin laundry in town that, in Linda's own
        words, \quotation{gives me the creeps and is a magnet for weirdos.} Even though
        the creepy coin laundry is what motivated Linda to invent the
        LaundroDone, she does not want to set foot back in there if she can
        avoid it. Instead, Linda plans to drive 120 miles to Los Angeles, book a
        hotel room, and spend a couple of days running her tests in several
        La-La Land coin laundries. Nothing wrong with this plan, but does she
        really have to drive that far to collect some of her first YODA?

        By applying the \quotation{test locally} tactic and using the Distance to Data
        metric as a guide, Linda identifies a midsized town with several not too
        creepy coin laundries that is less than 20 miles away. It's not as local
        as her hometown, but at least it's in the same county. By staying
        relatively close to home, she saves herself a 200-mile round-trip and
        hotel costs---time and money that she can use to run more tests. Makes
        sense, doesn't it?

        What happens, though, when your product idea is meant to be marketed,
        acquired, or used online? In that case you can replace units of physical
        distance with virtual ones such as emails, web posts, or web pages.
        Instead of counting physical steps, you count digital steps. It's easier
        than you think. Let me illustrate with another example.

        A few years ago I came up with an idea for an audio tone-control device
        to make poorly recorded music sound richer and less harsh. I identified
        the target market as audiophiles---people who spend a lot of money on
        audio equipment in search of sonic
        nirvana. These days,
        most audiophiles make their purchases online because brick-and-mortar
        audio stores are becoming as rare as bookstores. So my plan was to
        market and sell my audio device online, and I designed my pretotypes and
        tests accordingly.

        I wanted to follow the \quotation{test locally} tactic. But what does \quotation{local} mean
        online? In my case, I identified my virtual neighborhood as the internet
        audio forum that I visited regularly and to which I actively contributed
        with my own posts and audio product reviews. I was one of the first
        members of the forum, and I was on good terms with the forum's founder,
        so I figured that if I asked him nicely, he would let me write a post
        introducing my device to see if any forum members were interested in
        buying it. In this case, my DTD was three digital steps:

        \startenumerate
          \startitem
            Writing one email to the forum moderator
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Writing one post to introduce my product
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Creating a basic website with one landing page to collect some skin in
            the game (emails, deposits, \fsp{etc.}) from potential customers
          \stopitem
        \stopenumerate

        Because I was already a member of the forum and on friendly terms with
        its moderator, I was able to keep things in my \quotation{online neighborhood} and
        get my pretotype up and running very quickly.

        Keep \quotation{think globally, test locally} in mind when you craft your first
        xyz hypotheses. Don't just zoom in on a specific market; zoom in to
        where you are {\em now}. And speaking of now~.~.~.

        \section{Tactic 2: Testing Now Beats Testing Later}

        \quotation{Testing now beats testing later} does not require much explanation. The
        message is clear: don't delay testing. Take your
        idea---and your
        butt---out of Thoughtland and into the market as soon as possible. After
        you've identified your initial Market Engagement Hypothesis, expressed
        it in XYZ Hypothesis format, hypozoomed into xyz hypotheses, and
        designed a pretotyping experiment, it's time to move from abstract
        thinking to concrete testing.

        But most of us are reluctant to leave the comfort of Thoughtland. We
        dwell in it for months, sometimes years, thinking and talking about our
        idea, writing and revising our multiyear international business
        plan---even though we don't have a single piece of YODA that validates
        our idea. Why do we do that?

        I've been stuck in Thoughtland myself many times, so I feel qualified to
        posit an answer: fear! More precisely fear of rejection, the fear of
        finding out that there is no market interest for your beloved idea. Most
        people don't like to admit having this fear, but their actions indicate
        otherwise. I am no Sigmund Freud, but lingering in Thoughtland and
        postponing market contact might be a way to subconsciously avoid that
        potentially painful first contact with the market.

        I've often compared the fear of the pain, humiliation, and
        disappointment that can come from market rejection to the fear of
        romantic rejection. I get it, rejections---romantic or otherwise---are
        very unpleasant and psychologically difficult. But faint heart never won
        fair lady---or market share.

        There's no escaping the Law of Market Failure. Most of your ideas will
        be rejected by the market---and it will hurt. But the tools and tactics
        in this book will make this unpleasant yet unavoidable part of the
        process less painful, quicker, and easier to take. So don't delay. If
        your idea is going to be rejected, better to find out now rather than
        later.

        Over the years, I've worked with hundreds of teams on
        thousands of new
        product ideas, and I've noticed the following patterns:

        Teams that spent too much time in Thoughtland working with opinions and
        OPD and spent months writing business plans usually failed.

        Teams that rushed their product to market with minimal planning and
        testing usually failed.

        Teams that rushed to {\em test} the market usually succeeded.

        In other words, you don't want to spend too much time in Thoughtland,
        but you also don't want to rush a finished product to market. Instead,
        take that eagerness to launch your product into the market, and use it
        to first {\em test} the market.

        \subsection{Say It with Numbers: Hours to Data}

        {\em Hours to Data} (or HTD) is a measure of how many hours it will take
        you to execute a pretotyping experiment and collect some high-quality
        YODA. The HTD for our initial Second-Day Sushi pretotyping experiment,
        for example, was just two hours---that's all it took to print some
        labels and slap them on the boxes on display (and it helped that it was
        close to lunchtime).

        All things being equal, the shorter the HTD, the better. When I assign a
        pretotyping experiment to students, I typically set an HTD limit of
        forty-eight hours---and offer bonus points if they can prove that they
        got their YODA even more quickly. In one of my classes, while I was in
        the middle of explaining a pretotyping assignment, one of the students
        raised her hand, waved a \textdollar{}5 bill, and yelled, \quotation{Three minutes to data!
        How's that?}

        Before I had a chance to reply, she explained, \quotation{Our team's idea is a
        bicycle-cleaning and tune-up service. For \textdollar{}5 we will
        thoroughly clean
        your bike. For \textdollar{}10, we will also check the brakes, the shifters, lube
        the chain, and inflate the tires.} Murmurs of approval from other
        students in the class. \quotation{So,} she continued, \quotation{I sent an email message
        with the offer to our class and---}

        At that point a student sitting behind her stood up and said, \quotation{I saw the
        message and gave her the \textdollar{}5 just now. I want to be first in line,
        because with all this rain my bike is filthy and muddy.}

        I couldn't help smiling. I started to clap, and the rest of the class
        soon joined in. It was just one data point, but this student definitely
        understood the basic principle and spirit of Hours to Data. As you can
        imagine, by coming in with an HTD of 0.05 (three minutes is 0.05 hour)
        she recalibrated the expectations of everyone in the class (including
        me) and set a new standard. The competition was on.

        Note: Originally, I used a different name for this metric. I called it
        Time to Data. But I eventually changed it to Hours to Data in order to
        recalibrate expectations and increase the sense of urgency. It worked
        incredibly well. In both my classes and projects with corporate clients,
        the time it took teams to get their first YODA shrunk from a few days to
        a few hours.

        This name change, by the way, is an example of what psychologists call
        {\em priming} (or {\em anchoring}). By using hours as the basic unit of
        measure, I primed people to think in terms of hours and not days or
        weeks---and that's exactly what they did.

        \section{Tactic 3: Think Cheap, Cheaper, Cheapest}

        If you follow the techniques in this book, you will be able to collect
        high-quality YODA not only faster, but also much more cheaply than you
        could with other market-research approaches,
        possibly 10, 100, or
        even 1,000 times cheaper. Many of the companies I work with are
        accustomed to allocating months and hundreds of thousands of dollars for
        market research, so when they come up with a pretotyping experiment
        budget in \quotation{only} the tens of thousands, they are thrilled---but I am
        not. I tell them that going from hundreds of thousands to tens of
        thousands is good progress, but that they can probably get the same YODA
        for mere thousands or even just hundreds.

        Most ideas for new products can be properly tested with very little
        money---some with virtually no money. I like it best when \quotation{pizza for the
        team lunch} is the most expensive item in the pretotyping budget.

        I urge you not to settle on the first or second pretotyping experiment
        idea you come up with. Ask yourself, \quotation{Is this the best that we can do?}
        More often than not, you will come up with a cheaper way to test your
        idea that does not sacrifice YODA quality. Then try to do even better
        than that. The \quotation{think cheap, cheaper, cheapest} tactic was inspired by
        the following story.

        Henry Kissinger was a demanding boss. When he was Nixon's national
        security advisor, Kissinger asked one of his staff members to write a
        position paper for him. The staffer spent several days working on the
        document. When he thought that it was good enough, he presented it to
        his boss, who thanked him and said that he would read it later that
        evening.

        The next day Kissinger called the staffer in, handed the paper back, and
        asked him, \quotation{Is this the {\em best} that you can do?}

        Surprised and a bit embarrassed, the staffer said that he could probably
        do better. He canceled all of his other plans and spent several days
        focused on rewriting the paper.

        Kissinger's response to the revised version was the same: \quotation{Is {\em this}
        the best that you can do?}

        The staffer was
        stunned and felt humiliated, but he asked for another chance and swore
        that he would do much better this time. A few days later, he delivered
        the third version of the paper to his boss.

        Before the staffer left, Kissinger asked him, \quotation{Is this {\em really} the
        best that you can do?}

        \quotation{Yes, sir. It is really the best I can do,} the staffer answered.

        \quotation{Good. Now I will read it,} replied Kissinger.

        Since I was not present, I cannot vouch for the veracity or accuracy of
        this story, but I like Kissinger's approach, because it's rare that our
        first solution is the best, most effective, or most efficient one.

        In Google's early days, when the fledgling company's resources were
        stretched to the limit, many requests for an increased budget were often
        turned down with the phrase \quotation{Creativity loves constraints.} And guess
        what? Most of the time people found a way to make the available budget
        work.

        If you stir up your creative juices, you will usually discover a way to
        test your idea that is cheaper than your initial one. If you originally
        allocated a budget of \textdollar{}1,000 for your experiments, challenge yourself
        to find a way to reduce it to \textdollar{}100. And if you succeed at that, see if
        you can push it down to \textdollar{}10 or, even better, zero.

        \subsection{Say It with Numbers: Dollars to Data}

        {\em Dollars to Data} (\textdollar{}TD) does not require much explanation, and feel
        free to replace dollars with the appropriate currency for the project:
        dollars, euros, yuan, bitcoin, donuts~.~.~. Hey, wait a minute. Donuts?
        Yes, donuts. This metric does not have to be based on a conventional
        currency. If your project is staffed by volunteers and you reward them
        with breakfast donuts, then Donuts to Data is a reasonable metric to
        use.

        \section{Tactic 4: Tweak It and Flip It Before You Quit It}

        Don't let disappointing YODA from your initial set of experiments
        discourage you prematurely. The Right It might be just a few tweaks
        away---and pretotyping can help you find those tweaks. Let me explain.

        Most new product ideas, even the craziest-sounding ones, are usually
        based on not-so-crazy premises; the people behind those ideas are rarely
        lunatics (although I have met a few who would qualify). More often than
        not, they are people who have a decent understanding of the industry,
        believe that their idea solves a real problem for real customers, and
        are convinced that there is a bona fide market opportunity to take
        advantage of---and they are usually right about that. The problem is
        that their original idea is most likely in the close-but-no-cigar zone
        of that market opportunity. Let me illustrate, literally, what I mean.

        In the following image, the light gray area represents The Right It zone
        for a specific market opportunity, while the dark gray area represents
        The Wrong It zone.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/p187.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        The market opportunity is there, and it's real. But not all products
        that address it will be successful: they may be too expensive, too big,
        too complicated, come in the wrong color, have the wrong name, and so
        forth. The market can be very, very fussy and fastidious. If you don't
        come up with a product combination it likes
        (\fsp{i.e.}, The Right
        It), it will reject your idea---even if, in many other respects, your
        product does a good job of addressing the problem or opportunity. If you
        are really committed, or interested, or passionate about a specific
        market problem or opportunity, stick with that market, but tweak and
        experiment with variations on the original idea.

        Let's assume that you've run several pretotyping experiments with your
        initial idea (represented as It\low{1} in the next image), and the data
        shows conclusively that your idea---as it currently stands---is The
        Wrong It.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/p188.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        You are disappointed---and that's understandable. But in the process of
        testing that idea, you have discovered interesting facts about your
        target market. Perhaps you learned that one of your key
        Thoughtland-based assumptions was dead wrong (\fsp{e.g.}, most people {\em
        don't} think that \textdollar{}8 is too expensive for packaged sushi). Or you
        observed that 80\textpercent{} of packaged-sushi shoppers carefully
        inspect the label to check the \quotation{packaged on} time stamp---and put the
        box back if that time indicates that the box is more than a day old.
        With each experiment, you gained valuable YODA you can use to inform and
        guide your next step.

        Even if the original idea for Second-Day Sushi proves to be The Wrong
        It, it is quite plausible that somewhere in the Thoughtland neighborhood
        from which Second-Day Sushi originated dwells an idea and business model
        for budget packaged sushi that is The Right It. Try testing a weekly
        subscription service and tweak the name and slogan to suggest
        convenience rather than
        a lack of freshness:
        \quotation{Sushi2You: The convenient and affordable sushi subscription service.}

        And if the market does not respond to that particular tweak, explore and
        pretotype a few more tweaks (\fsp{e.g.}, \quotation{Groupie Sushi: Order sushi as a
        group and save}) until you find a combination that is The Right It.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/p189a.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        But what if, even after a bunch of tweaks, you still haven't found The
        Right It?

        At that point you should consider the very real possibility that, as the
        image below shows, The Right It for the budget-sushi idea does not
        exist; all variations on that idea are destined to fail, because too
        many people associate cheap sushi with bad sushi---and bad sushi with
        all sorts of nasty consequences.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/p189b.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        What now? Well, if your heart is set on being in the packaged-sushi
        business one way or another, it's time to turn up your creativity by
        several notches and explore another set of variations on the
        packaged-sushi theme.

        I used to think of myself as somewhat of an expert in creativity, a
        master of brainstorming, until I met a real expert on the subject:
        Stanford professor Tina
        Seelig.\footnote{I highly recommend
        Tina's book {\em inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity} (San Francisco:
        HarperOne, 2012)---the next best thing to taking one of her classes.} In 2016 I had
        the honor of
        teaching a graduate course titled \quotation{Creativity and Innovation} alongside
        Tina. The objective of the course was to teach students how to develop
        innovative solutions to problems by combining creativity techniques (in
        order to come up with a large initial number of ideas) with pretotyping
        techniques (in order to test, validate, and whittle the initial set of
        ideas down to the ones most likely to succeed). I focused on teaching
        pretotyping, and when Tina was teaching creativity techniques, I sat
        alongside the students, paying rapt attention and furiously taking
        notes.

        In one of the class exercises, students were assigned a challenge (\fsp{e.g.},
        stop people from texting while driving) and had to come up with at least
        one hundred innovative ideas that could help solve the problem. As
        two-time Nobel Prize--winner Linus Pauling famously said, \quotation{The best way
        to have a great idea is to have a lot of ideas.} But coming up with a
        lot of ideas to solve a single problem sounds easier than it actually
        is---if you don't know the right techniques. Most people struggle to get
        past forty or fifty ideas in this exercise and conclude that they are
        simply not creative enough.

        Tina would strongly disagree with that conclusion; she believes that
        creativity is a skill that we can all learn and proves her point by
        teaching a set of techniques that makes the \quotation{one hundred ideas} exercise
        one hundred times easier. In one of the class's most memorable and
        effective lessons, using a Harvard case study about Cirque du Soleil as
        an example, Tina showed the students how to take their preconceived
        notions and assumptions about a specific idea and flip them over to
        reveal alternatives that might lead to a successful variation on an
        existing idea. In an article she posted on Medium.com, Tina describes
        the exercise as follows:

        One of my favorite
        exercises involves unpacking all the assumptions you have and then
        turning them upside down to reveal alternatives.

        In my creativity course, I use a Harvard case study about Cirque du
        Soleil that gives students a chance to hone their skills at challenging
        assumptions. The backdrop is the 1980s, when the circus industry was in
        trouble. Performances were predictable and stale, the number of
        customers was diminishing, and animal treatment was under attack. It
        didn't seem like a good time to start a new circus. But that is exactly
        what Guy Laliberté, a street performer in Canada, did by challenging
        every assumption about what a circus could be.

        After showing a video clip from the 1939 Marx Brothers movie, {\em At
        the Circus}, I ask the students to list all the assumptions we have for
        a traditional circus: a big tent, animals, cheap tickets, barkers
        selling souvenirs, several acts performing at once, clowns, popcorn,
        strong men, flaming hoops, \fsp{etc.}

        I then ask them to turn these things upside down---to imagine the exact
        opposite of each one.

        For example, the new list would include a small tent, no animals,
        expensive seats, no barkers, one act performing at a time, and no clowns
        or popcorn. They then pick the things they want to keep from the
        traditional circus and the things they want to change. The result is a
        brand-new type of circus, à la Cirque du Soleil. And we all know that
        Cirque du Soleil is thriving, while the traditional circus is
        essentially gone.

        Once we do this exercise with the circus industry, it's easy to apply to
        other industries and institutions that are ripe for change, including
        fast-food restaurants, hotels, airlines,
        education, and even
        courtship and marriage. When you get the hang of it, this is an easy,
        back-of-the-envelope exercise you can use to reevaluate all aspects of
        your life and career. The key is to take the time to clearly identify
        every assumption. This is usually the hardest part, since assumptions
        are often so integrated into our view of the world that it's hard to see
        them. However, with a little practice, it becomes a useful way to look
        at your options in a fresh
        light.\footnote{Tina Seelig, \quotation{What Does
        Your Life Look Like Upside Down?} Medium, August 3, 2017,
        \goto{\hyphenatedurl{https://medium.com/@tseelig/what-does-your-life-look-like-upside-down-66a5048df461}}[url(https://medium.com/@tseelig/what-does-your-life-look-like-upside-down-66a5048df461)].}

        Let's apply this creativity technique to packaged sushi. Since we've
        already explored going the cheaper route with Second-Day Sushi, let's
        have some fun and go the other way. Let's flip our fishy idea on its
        head and go upscale: \quotation{Superior Sushi: the freshest and highest-quality
        packaged sushi you can buy.} Who knows? We might learn that although
        there's not much of a market for cheaper, less-fresh packaged sushi,
        there is a strong market for extra fresh sushi that comes in a premium
        package. All we need to do is make a list of what people typically
        assume about or associate with packaged sushi and then come up with
        alternatives suitable for our Superior Sushi idea. For example:

        Yum, I am getting
        hungry just thinking about it. I must admit that I like the Superior
        Sushi idea a whole lot better than Second-Day Sushi. I can even imagine
        myself spending an extra few dollars to get fresher fish, real wasabi
        (not that artificially colored green stuff that comes in tubes), a
        bamboo box that I can save and use for something else, and a cute little
        glass bottle of premium soy sauce instead of those plastic soy packets.
        But that's just me in Thoughtland. How many other people would actually
        spend close to \textdollar{}20 for packaged sushi---regardless of how fancy the
        packaging is? I am sure that by now you know what you need to do in
        order to answer that question.

        By the way, you don't necessarily have to wait for a new product idea to
        turn out to be The Wrong It before you start tweaking it and exploring
        other ideas. Our tools and techniques give you the power to test any
        idea quickly and efficiently; that means that now you are in a position
        to test several different ideas (or different tweaks on a basic idea)
        before committing to a specific one. You don't have to come up with one
        hundred different versions of an idea (although, why not?), but you
        should think of at least a few different ones, because chances are your
        first idea may not be the best idea.

        \subsection{Tweaks Beat Pivots}

        Most people understand that it's unlikely that the first version of
        their idea is The Right It. They know that few ideas come out of
        Thoughtland fully baked and ready to succeed{\em .} They assume that
        they will have to do some tweaking. Unfortunately, they do their
        tweaking in Thoughtland, using opinions and OPD instead of YODA to guide
        them. No wonder most ideas flop miserably when they hit the market.

        The only way to discover what the market {\em really} wants and
        tweak accordingly is
        to make {\em real} contact with it. Don't just {\em ask} the market what
        it {\em thinks} it wants; put a pretotype of your idea out in the market
        and {\em demand} some skin in the game as evidence of interest. The
        sooner you do that, the better, because the longer you wait, the more
        painful and expensive the lessons get. And eventually you will find
        yourself too beaten up, too discouraged, and with no resources left to
        try other tweaks.

        These days, the term {\em pivot} is tossed around a lot by
        entrepreneurs, product managers, and venture capitalists. A pivot is
        generally understood to be a {\em major} change in the fundamental idea
        or market hypothesis for a new product or business. You are forced to
        pivot because---surprise, surprise---the original idea turned out to be
        The Wrong It. The problem with most pivots is that, unlike tweaks, they
        happen {\em after} the team has already invested significant time and
        money in developing the original idea. I participated in several pivots
        earlier in my career, but we didn't use that term at the time. We just
        said, \quotation{We screwed up!} When the word {\em pivot} enters the conversation
        in a product meeting, it's inevitably accompanied by that most pungent
        of aromas: {\em eau de desperation}. By then, the team will have usually
        wasted most of their resources on The Wrong It, severely limiting their
        options. It does not have to happen this way.

        If you pretotype your idea early on and make your tweaks along the way,
        you will avoid traumatic pivots and dramatically increase your chances
        of eventually landing The Right It. Ten tiny tweaks are better than one
        painful pivot.

      \startchapter[title={Complete Example: BusU},reference=chapter:8]
        We are now ready to see how the various tools and tactics we've learned
        fit together. I'll pick an idea for a new business, and we'll work
        through the entire process from Thoughtland, to data, to decision. I
        will not only show you the steps I'd take, but also give you insights
        into my thought process as the plan unfolds. Keep in mind that this is
        only one of a myriad of possible ways we can apply these techniques.
        There is no single best approach. If you think you would do things
        differently or better, that's great; it means I've taught you well.

        The new business idea we'll use for this example popped into my head
        while crawling along in commute traffic on Highway 101 on my way from my
        home in Silicon Valley to downtown San Francisco for a morning meeting.
        A few years ago, this drive would have taken about forty-five minutes.
        Today, with the business and building boom all over the Bay Area, it can
        take up to two hours to cover less than 40 miles, and thousands of
        people make this three- to four-hour round-trip commute every single
        day. What a waste---and what an opportunity!

        That morning, while
        staring at a river of red brake lights, I came up with the idea for
        BusU: turn commuter buses into classrooms and commute time into learning
        time. While inching toward my destination, I even had time to come up
        with a slogan: \quotation{Take a class on the bus.}

        I don't believe, of course, that I was the first to have had this idea.
        Others may have already thought of such a business. Some may have even
        tried to build it, and we may learn something from their attempts. But
        by now you should know how I feel about using other people's success or
        failure with similar ideas. We might take OPD into account, but that's
        no substitute for running our own experiments and collecting our YODA.

        Below is a rough outline of the key steps we'll take to collect that
        YODA and use it to guide our decisions. As you can see, we will be using
        all three sets of tools (thinking tools, pretotyping tools, analysis
        tools):

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Describe the original BusU idea.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Identify BusU's Market Engagement Hypothesis (MEH).
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Write BusU's MEH in XYZ Hypothesis format.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Hypozoom into xyz hypotheses we can test quickly.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Identify a set of pretotyping experiments we can use to validate our
            hypotheses.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Tactically prioritize experiments based on Distance to Data (DTD),
            Hours to Data (HTD), and Dollars to Data (\textdollar{}TD).
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Run the first set of experiments.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Based on an objective analysis of the YODA from the experiments,
            determine the next steps.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Remember---this is
        just our coarse, initial plan. Like all such plans, it's likely to
        change once our idea makes contact with the market and we collect our
        first data. After we get going, we may find ourselves backtracking or
        jumping around in those steps quite a bit. For example, right in the
        middle of running our first pretotyping experiment, we may run into an
        unexpected obstacle or an opportunity that will dramatically affect our
        Market Engagement Hypothesis (\fsp{e.g.}, California passes a law that makes
        it illegal to run businesses on buses). Or, as often happens, while
        working on it, our original idea morphs into a different and potentially
        much better or bigger idea. Prepare yourself to be surprised and to gain
        new insights, and don't hesitate to revise any or all of your plans and
        hypotheses. You are entering unknown territory, so you should be
        flexible and adaptable. This is why Part III is called \quotation{{\em Plastic}
        Tactics.}

        But although our tactics may change, our guiding principles will not. We
        will use our tools to think clearly, test thoroughly, and analyze
        objectively.

        \section{Thinking Clearly About Our Idea}

        \subsection{The Original Idea}

        Here's how, while stuck in traffic, I originally envisioned the BusU
        idea:

        By partnering with local universities, BusU will offer accredited
        college-level classes taught by top-rated professors while transporting
        professionals to and from work each day. The buses will be customized to
        resemble a classroom and will have a capacity of 30 to 50 students.
        We will begin by
        offering BusU service from San Francisco to Silicon Valley and back. The
        length of the commute is perfect for offering a standard fifty-minute
        class each way.

        To make the numbers work, we envision BusU as high-end executive and
        professional training, and it will be priced accordingly. We anticipate
        a fee of \textdollar{}3,000 for a ten-week course. This fee may seem high, but we
        expect that most high-tech companies that already subsidize continuing
        education and training for their employees will cover at least part of
        the tuition.

        That's a pretty good high-level description of our vision for BusU.
        We've even managed to add some interesting details and included some
        numbers---all of which will make writing the XYZ Hypothesis and xyz
        hypotheses easier. But before we do that, we must take the next critical
        step: identifying the Market Engagement Hypothesis (MEH).

        \subsection{Market Engagement Hypothesis}

        As we've seen in \in{Part}[part:1], lasting
        business success requires that many factors and assumptions line up just
        right. For BusU to succeed, we must be able to find accredited
        universities and proven college professors willing to work with us; it
        must be possible---and not too expensive---to customize buses for
        classroom use without violating transportation safety standards; and so
        on. But in this case, as it is in the great majority of cases, the most
        important assumption we need to test and validate relates to market
        interest. Remember, \quotation{If there's a market, there's a way.} If there's
        enough market interest, we will find ways to partner with schools,
        recruit professors, and meet transportation standards.

        Since the target
        customers for BusU are business professionals with long commutes, our
        MEH should be based on this segment of the population. Will enough
        professionals be willing to pay private university--level tuition to
        take a class on a bus?

        Here's our first rough pass at the MEH:

        {\bf A lot of professionals with long commutes will pay university-level
        tuition to take buses with classes.}

        It's a start, but it's too vague and fuzzy a description to be of much
        use. What's \quotation{a lot of professionals}? How long is \quotation{a long commute}? How
        much is \quotation{university-level tuition}? We need to {\em say it with numbers}
        and express it in a way that can be tested by experiment and
        observation.

        \subsection{XYZ Hypothesis}

        Let's combine our Thoughtland-based vision (which already includes some
        numbers) with our MEH, so we can express the latter in XYZ Hypothesis
        format, at least X\textpercent{} of Y will Z:

        {\bf {\em At least} 2\textpercent{} of working professionals with
        daily commutes of one hour or longer each way {\em will} pay \textdollar{}3,000 to
        take an accredited ten-week class on BusU at least once a year.}

        Nice! We've shaved off a lot of fuzz, made our implicit assumptions
        explicit, and included an educated guess at some numbers that we can use
        in our experiments.

        If we can get at least 2\textpercent{} of our target market to take a
        \textdollar{}3,000 BusU class once a year, we'll have a good foundation for making
        BusU a viable and valuable business. But that's a big {\em if}. It all
        sounds very promising, reasonable, and plausible; remember, however,
        that we are still in Thoughtland at this point and, for all we know, we
        are be about to fall into a false-positive trap. Time
        for our idea to pack
        its bag, say good-bye to Thoughtland, and get ready to be tested in the
        real world. Time to hypozoom.

        \subsection{From XYZ to xyz}

        Our next step is to take our XYZ Hypothesis and turn it into three xyz
        hypotheses that we can test quickly and easily with pretotyping. We want
        to minimize our investment of time and money by using what we already
        have available to us---and near us. Time to put the \quotation{think globally,
        test locally} tactic into action.

        I begin by looking at my current situation and resources to see what I
        can leverage and put to good use:

        I live in Mountain View, California, home to Google and LinkedIn. Both
        companies employ thousands of professionals and offer them education
        subsidies and tuition reimbursements.

        Many Google and LinkedIn employees who work in Mountain View live in San
        Francisco and commute to work either by car or on company-sponsored
        buses.

        I have many friends who work at Google and a few who work at LinkedIn.

        I have a great relationship with several top-notch Stanford professors.

        Bottom line: I have access to a wealth of resources I can use for my
        first experiments. Many of the people who work at Google and LinkedIn
        are engineers and, since most engineers are eager learners, they are a
        great subset of BusU's target market for our initial test. But should I
        use Google or LinkedIn (or both)
        for our first set of
        experiments? To help me decide, I can use the Distance to Data metric.

        Geographically speaking, Google's and LinkedIn's offices are both less
        than 10 miles from my home and within a couple of miles of each
        other---so that's a tie. But since I know many more people at Google
        than I do at LinkedIn, if I measure DTD in terms of the number of emails
        I will have to send in order to reach the right people, then Google
        emerges as the better choice. I can save my LinkedIn contacts for future
        experiments to see if they confirm the data from my experiments with
        Google employees. So my initial zoomed-in target market (\fsp{i.e.}, the {\em
        y} in xyz) will be Google engineers who live in San Francisco and work
        at the company's Mountain View campus.

        Great! Now that we have an easy-to-reach target market, we can use it to
        hypozoom. Here are three xyz hypotheses I can test using this group:

        {\bf xyz1: At least 40\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View who hear about BusU will visit the
        BusU4Google.com website and submit their google.com email address to be
        informed of upcoming classes.}

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        {\bf xyz2: At least 20\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will attend a one-hour lunchtime
        presentation to learn more about BusU.}

        \middlealigned{\blackrule}

        {\bf xyz3: At least 10\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will pay \textdollar{}300 for a one-week
        \quotation{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence} class on the bus taught by a
        Stanford AI professor.}

        Before we go
        further, let me address a question you may have about the numbers I've
        chosen for the value of {\em x} in these xyz hypotheses. I used
        2\textpercent{} for X in the XYZ Hypothesis, so why do I use
        40\textpercent{}, 20\textpercent{}, and 10\textpercent{} for {\em
        x} in the hypozoomed xyz hypotheses?

        I did that because I am taking into account what is commonly called the
        {\em conversion funnel}. Not every person who walks into a store,
        attends a free seminar, or visits an ecommerce website becomes a paying
        customer. Quite the opposite. Data consistently shows that only a small
        fraction of people who sign up for free trials or seminars or visit a
        website convert to paying customers.

        Out of every hundred people you invite to learn more about your new
        product, you'd be lucky if you got five of them to accept or follow up
        on your invitation (\fsp{e.g.}, by coming to your store or visiting your
        website for more information). And out of those five or so, perhaps only
        one or two of them will end up making a purchase or some other form of
        commitment. Perhaps none of them will.

        The other reason those three xyz hypotheses have different values for
        {\em x} is that each hypothesis involves a different amount of skin in
        the game:

        {\bf xyz1:} 1 point for a valid email address

        {\bf xyz2:} 60 points for an hour of time to attend a presentation

        {\bf xyz3:} 900 points for committing to pay \textdollar{}300 and attend a
        one-week class (300 points for the \textdollar{}300; 600 points for spending {\em
        at least} ten hours attending a class on a bus)

        As the amount of skin in the game increases, you must anticipate that
        the number of people who sign up will decrease. Remember also that all
        of these numbers are, for now, just educated guesses---a starting point.
        Our experiments will tell us whether or
        not these figures
        are even in the ballpark; if they are not, we will revise our working
        hypothesis and plan the next steps accordingly.

        Even after this explanation, you may still have some issues with how
        accurate or valid you think these hypotheses are. You might have even
        thought of much better hypotheses we could have used. Or perhaps you
        believe that my numbers are unrealistic or way off.

        {\em Fantastic!} That's the whole point of going through the effort of
        turning high-level ideas into detailed XYZ and xyz hypotheses. That's
        why we {\em say it with numbers}. Those initial numbers are only
        guesstimates for now (a {\em guesstimate} is a combination of a guess
        and an estimate). They are meant to stimulate discussion and bring
        differences of opinion and disagreements to the surface, so we can
        resolve them. If this were a real situation and we were part of a team
        exploring the idea for BusU, we'd invest a couple of hours discussing
        several possible xyz hypotheses before converging on a few. And then,
        after a couple of experiments and some further thought, we would
        probably revise them once again---or come up with completely new ones.
        That's how it works. That's how it's supposed to work.

        So with the understanding that these may not be the best possible xyz
        hypotheses or the right initial numbers and that you'd handle this
        better or differently, let's proceed.

        \section{Time to Test}

        We have three xyz hypotheses to choose from, and we have to pick one of
        them to pretotype for our first test. Each one of these hypotheses will
        provide us with valuable data, but which one should we start with?

        \subsection{Choosing Our First Pretotype}

        We've already applied the \quotation{test locally} tactic, so let's see how the
        \quotation{testing now beats testing later} and \quotation{think cheap, cheaper, cheapest}
        tactics can help us determine where to start. To do that, we'll evaluate
        and score each xyz hypothesis in terms of Hours to Data and Dollars to
        Data. Let's begin.

        {\bf xyz1: At least 40\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View who hear about BusU will visit the
        BusU4Google.com website and will submit their google.com email address
        to be informed of upcoming classes.}

        To test xyz1, all we need to do is reach at least 100 Google engineers
        and develop a simple website. We estimate that that will take a couple
        of days at most and just a few dollars. The time and cost estimate for
        xyz1 is:

        Hours to Data: about 48

        Dollars to Data: less than \textdollar{}100

        That's pretty darn good.

        Let's see how xyz2 fares:

        {\bf xyz2: At least 20\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will attend a one-hour lunchtime
        presentation to learn more about BusU.}

        To test xyz2, we still need access to 100 Google engineers, but we also
        need at least a few hours to create the presentation and a couple of
        weeks to get it on Google's calendar, send out the announcements, and so
        on. This experiment will get us more skin
        in the game, but it
        will also require more time and effort to set up than xyz1. The time and
        cost estimate for xyz2 is:

        Hours to Data: at least
        336\footnote{That \quotation{336 hours}
        looks awkward, doesn't it? Great! It's supposed to. At this stage I want
        you to think in terms of hours, not weeks.} (two weeks)

        Dollars to Data: less than \textdollar{}100

        Not bad. But \quotation{testing now beats testing later,} and xyz1 can get us YODA
        faster than xyz2. So that is still our top choice for the first
        pretotyping experiment.

        What about xyz3?

        {\bf xyz3: At least 10\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will pay \textdollar{}300 for a one-week
        \quotation{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence} class on the bus taught by a
        Stanford AI professor.}

        This would require even more time and effort than xyz2. We'd have to
        line up (and possibly pay) a professor willing to do this, rent a bus,
        and so on. The time and cost estimate for xyz3 is:

        Hours to Data: at least 672 (four weeks)

        Dollars to Data: more than \textdollar{}5,000

        Compared to most market-research budgets, this qualifies as fast and
        cheap. But for us pretotypers, at this stage that's way too much time
        and way too much money. Remember, \quotation{Testing now beats testing later} and
        \quotation{Think cheap, cheaper, cheapest.} At this point xyz1 is our fastest and
        cheapest route to YODA.

        By applying our tactics and associated metrics, we've identified an xyz
        hypothesis (xyz1) that will give us our first taste
        of data in a couple
        of days and for just a fistful of dollars. If our initial experiments
        validate xyz1, we will then have YODA to justify investing a bit more
        time and money to test xyz2. And if xyz2 is validated, we can then
        justify investing a lot more time and money to test xyz3. But let's not
        get ahead of ourselves. We have a great starting point, so let's move on
        to pretotyping.

        \subsection{Executing Our First Pretotyping Experiment}

        Here's the first hypothesis we will put to the test:

        {\bf xyz1: At least 40\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View who hear about BusU will visit the
        BusU4Google.com website and will submit their google.com email address
        to be informed of upcoming classes.}

        The next question I ask myself is this: What's the best way to reach our
        {\em y}, the target market of Google engineers who commute from San
        Francisco to Mountain View?

        Knowing Google, I assume the company has an internal website or mailing
        list for people who want to carpool with other Google employees or ride
        the Google buses. I ask one of my friends currently working at the
        company to see if that's the case. He reports back to me with a list of
        several such resources, including an unofficial (\fsp{i.e.}, employee managed)
        mailing list called MTVCarPoolers with over 1,600 members. Bingo!

        I get an introduction to Beth, the list administrator, and we schedule a
        meeting so I can share the BusU idea with her. Beth loves the concept
        and agrees to help me test it. She confirms that more than half of the
        list members (820 of them to be exact) commute from San Francisco to the
        main Google campus in Mountain View. Perfect. I have potential customers
        for running at least
        eight different tests with 100 people each. (Since I am using a group of
        people that is representative of my hypothesized target market, 100
        people is an adequate sample size for the results to be statistically
        meaningful.)

        Now that I have an easy (and free) way to reach my target market, we
        need to create a pretotype website to establish a web presence we can
        use to collect our first YODA. I buy a suitable domain name and use one
        of the many drag-and-drop website development services (\fsp{e.g.},
        Squarespace, Weebly, Wix) to create a three-page website that introduces
        and explains the BusU concept. The total investment is \textdollar{}20 and about
        two hours of my time---easy, fast, and cheap.

        The website describes how the BusU service works and lists examples of
        the classes that will be offered and the bios of the professors who will
        teach them. Visitors to the site are asked to fill in the following form
        (skin in the game) if they want more information:

        Name:

        Email:

        Google job title:

        Classes and topics you are interested in:

        Comments or questions:

        I show the pretotype website and the form to Beth. She asks me to make a
        change; she wants us to be up front with the fact that the service is
        not yet available but is currently being explored and that it is likely
        to happen if there is enough interest in it. Beth understands the
        importance of testing the idea first, but she wants to be as forthright
        and as ethical as possible. No problem. In fact, I thank her for
        bringing this up. I make those changes, and then we work together to
        compose the email
        message we will send
        to the first 100 Google employees on the San Francisco-to-Mountain View
        commuter list.

        The next morning Beth sends out the email. In less than four hours, 88
        people visit the website and 62 of them fill in the form. Woo-hoo! This
        is great. I had estimated 40\textpercent{} of the people would fill
        out the email form, and we got 62\textpercent{}.

        But when I look at the data more closely, I notice that almost everyone
        who submitted a form asks if the service is free and, if not, they want
        to know how much it will cost and whether Google will help pay for it.
        Oops! I guess we should make those monetary points clearer in our email
        or on the website, especially since Google workers are accustomed to
        free meals, free massages, and many other perks.

        I talk to Beth about the feedback, and we agree that for the next
        experiment I should edit both the email and website, being up front
        about the cost (\textdollar{}3,000 for a ten-week class---which includes the bus
        ride). We also make it clear that at this time this is not a
        Google-approved continuing education program and that the students are
        responsible for the full tuition.

        But before we tackle the next experiment, let's discuss how we would
        score this first experiment on the TRI Meter and what, if anything, we
        need to tweak in our hypotheses.

        \section{Analyzing and Iterating}

        Hypothesis xyz1 predicted a 40\textpercent{} response, and our test
        returned a very healthy 62\textpercent{}. This result exceeds our
        expectations and indicates a strong level of interest. Normally, a
        number this good (\fsp{i.e.}, substantially better than our estimate) is an
        indication that an idea is Very Likely to succeed. But since we did not
        mention the hefty
        \textdollar{}3,000 price tag in our email and many Google workers may have assumed
        that the BusU classes would be free (or be reimbursed by Google), I
        decide to be conservative in my interpretation of the result. Instead of
        Very Likely, I score it as Likely.

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image209.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        I could have been even more conservative and scored the experimental
        result as 50/50 or tossed it away as bad data. But getting a greater
        than 60\textpercent{} response to any idea in any market happens so
        rarely that I decided to take it as evidence of strong market interest,
        and \quotation{If there's a market, there's a way.} The next set of experiments
        will determine whether I am right or wrong.

        We have an encouraging first result, but the big black arrow on the TRI
        Meter is doing its job. It's keeping us grounded in reality. It reminds
        us that most new ideas will fail in the market and that we need to have
        several more successful experiments---a preponderance of positive
        evidence---to balance out the Law of Market Failure.

        In the meantime, Beth meets with Google's continuing
        education program
        manager and learns that Google will not consider BusU an approved
        educational expense until it is more established and has proven to
        provide comparable value to offerings by more traditional and already
        accredited educational institutions. Ouch. I ask a friend who works at
        LinkedIn to see if his company has a similar policy. Alas, the answer he
        comes back with is not what we want to hear: \quotation{They say that you need to
        have some track record and/or accreditation before they'll consider it a
        refundable employee education expense.}

        Darn! It looks like we should remove the possibility of employer subsidy
        from our hypothesis---at least at first. That's disappointing, but \quotation{now
        beats later} also applies to bad news---better to know now, rather than
        later, that we cannot count on company subsidies until BusU is more
        established.

        I edit both the email and the website. I make explicit the \textdollar{}3,000
        tuition cost and make it clear that---at least for now---BusU classes
        are not eligible for Google's educational reimbursement. Then I cross my
        fingers and send out the next batch of 100 emails.

        This time the results are less encouraging: only 42 visits to the
        website and, out of those, only 22 people submitted a filled-in form. I
        am disappointed but not surprised. When people are faced with the
        \textdollar{}3,000 cost and the lack of company sponsorship (at least for the time
        being), it's normal that fewer would be interested.

        We had a plan, but we got punched in the face---not by Mike Tyson, but
        by the market. What now? Time to bring the {\em plastic} in plastic
        tactics into action.

        The 22\textpercent{} response figure is approximately half our initial
        estimate of 40\textpercent{}. But considering that the 22 people who
        replied were okay with paying \textdollar{}3,000 for the class out of their own
        pocket, I conclude
        that this number is actually quite good---something we can work with.
        Are we just lowering our expectations? No! We are testing, calibrating,
        and adjusting our initial assumptions against reality. We are not
        \quotation{cheating.} It is true that we are getting a lower rate of response, but
        those who are responding are willing to put more of their own skin in
        the game (\fsp{i.e.}, their own money instead of Google's).

        To reflect this change, we can tweak xyz1 as follows:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Lower our expected market engagement rate (x) from 40 to
            20\textpercent{}
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Mention the \textdollar{}3,000 cost
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            State up front that the courses are not eligible for company
            reimbursement
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Here's what this tweaked xyz1 would look like:

        {\bf xyz1A: At least 20\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View who hear about BusU's \textdollar{}3,000 (not
        eligible for company reimbursement) courses will visit the
        BusU4Google.com website and will submit their google.com email address
        to be informed of upcoming classes.}

        Alternatively, we could:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Keep the 40\textpercent{} number
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Use a smaller tuition number (say \textdollar{}1,000)
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        Here's what this tweaked xyz1 would look like:

        {\bf xyz1B: At least 40\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View who hear about BusU's
        \textdollar{}1,000 (not
        eligible for company reimbursement) courses will visit the
        BusU4Google.com website and will submit their google.com email address
        to be informed of upcoming classes.}

        Or we could move on to pretotyping xyz2 or xyz3. We have several
        available options open to us. But while we are pondering the next steps
        something happens~.~.~.

        \section{A Lucky Break}

        I get the following email from a Google employee named Bob:

        Hi Alberto, I heard about your BusU idea from my friend Emily with whom
        I often commute to work. I love the concept, and I'd love to teach a
        class. I have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Berkeley, and I
        already have a ten-hour \quotation{Intro to Machine Learning} minicourse that I've
        taught several times at both Berkeley and Google (to great reviews,
        average 4.8/5.0). This would be a lot of fun for me, so you don't even
        have to pay me. When can we start?

        I am thrilled by Bob's email and by his offer to teach an intro to AI
        class for free. In fact, it's almost too good to be true. Remember xyz3?

        {\bf xyz3: At least 10\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will pay \textdollar{}300 for a one-week
        \quotation{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence} class on the bus taught by a
        Stanford AI professor.}

        Bob is not a Stanford professor, and Machine Learning is a specific
        subset of AI, but close enough. This is a major lucky
        break! But I am not
        too surprised by it. I have learned to expect things like this to happen
        when I get out of Thoughtland and begin to pretotype my ideas in the
        real world.

        After I review the data from the first pretotypes and consider this new
        development, I decide on a new course of action. I meet with Bob and
        tweak xyz3 as follows:

        {\bf xyz3A: At least 10\textpercent{} of Google engineers commuting
        from San Francisco to Mountain View will pay \textdollar{}300 for a one-week
        \quotation{Introduction to Machine Learning} class on the bus taught by a fellow
        Google employee.}

        Next, I call several local transportation companies and learn that
        chartering a suitable 40-person bus (including driver) from San
        Francisco to Mountain View will cost approximately \textdollar{}1,000 per day, or
        \textdollar{}5,000 per week. I also learn that some of the buses already have
        television screens that the instructors can use to project slides or as
        electronic blackboards. Great.

        I calculate that if I can get at least twenty people to sign up (at
        \textdollar{}300 each) for the one-week AI class, I can cover the bus rental cost,
        gain some valuable firsthand experience running such a service, and even
        pay Bob for his time and commitment. Based on YODA from the previous
        experiment, I estimate that if we email 200 Google employees, we should
        get at least 10\textpercent{} of them to sign up for such a class. And
        if we get more, even better---the bus can accommodate up to forty
        people.

        I tell Beth about Bob's offer and explain our new plan. She's impressed
        and even more enthusiastic than before: \quotation{I love the idea of employees
        teaching other employees.} After confirming available dates with
        professor Bob, I list our first real course on the website and add a
        registration and an online payment page.

        The next day, Beth sends an email to two hundred Google
        employees on the
        list describing the class, the \textdollar{}300 cost, and the schedule. The message
        makes it clear that this is not a Google-sanctioned service, but a pilot
        program for a new company, and that it does not qualify as a
        reimbursable educational expense.

        In less than two days forty-eight people register and pay! We sell out
        our first class and even have eight people on the waiting list. That's a
        24\textpercent{} (48 out 200) response rate---considerably better than
        our 10\textpercent{} estimate for xyz3A. Things are looking really
        good.

        We now have \textdollar{}14,400 in the BusU bank account---that's 14,400
        skin-in-the-game points (300 points for each \textdollar{}300 payment times 48
        registered students). That's a lot of the kind of YODA I like. The
        initial set of customers are also committing many hours of their time
        (even more skin in the game), but since they'd be spending that time on
        the commute anyway, I play it conservatively and decide not to include
        that in the skin-in-the-game calculation. It's time to board the bus!

        I reserve the charter bus and, two weeks later, at 8:30 \fsp{a.m.} on a rainy
        Monday morning, the first BusU class leaves San Francisco with
        thirty-five students on board. Why only thirty-five people? Three people
        could not make it because of a change of plans---and ask for a refund.
        And two of them arrive late and miss the bus. Unfortunately, it is too
        late to get the people on the waiting list to fill in the empty seats. I
        issue the refunds, and I still have plenty of money to cover the cost of
        the pretotype. However, if I go forward with the idea, I will have to
        account for these kinds of situations by coming up with a refund and
        missed-the-bus policy. Perhaps I can do something similar to what
        airlines do and overbook the class by 5\textpercent{} or
        10\textpercent{}. These are the kinds of invaluable real-world lessons
        you learn and data you collect by running pretotypes.

        On the plus side,
        the rest of the week goes very smoothly. Thirty-five students finish the
        one-week course and get the inaugural batch of BusU diplomas.

        What's next? We had a successful first experiment, but we need more
        data. Specifically, we'd love to know if the {\em initial} level of
        interest in BusU will translate into an {\em ongoing} level of interest.
        Most businesses need repeat customers to be successful and stay
        profitable, and BusU is no exception. What percentage of our initial
        customers will sign up for another course?

        \subsection{From New Data to New Decision}

        It is customary to have students fill out a questionnaire after a course
        to rate the material and the instructor. In addition to that, such
        surveys also ask questions like, \quotation{Would you take another course from
        BusU?} and \quotation{Would you recommend BusU to your colleagues?} By now, you
        should realize that the answers to such \quotation{Would you~.~.~. ?} questions
        may provide you with some interesting insights, but they are not
        data---because there's no skin in the game. So rather than asking
        skinless hypothetical questions, Bob and I decide to send an email offer
        to the first group of students with two skin-in-the-game options for the
        next class:

        {\bf Option 1:} A \textdollar{}3,000 full ten-week AI course (as in the
        original plan)

        {\bf Option 2:} A \textdollar{}300 one-week follow-up course, \quotation{Machine
        Learning 201}

        We also ask them to share with us any feedback or suggestions they might
        have.

        Two days later, we look at our new data:

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Twenty-one people
            signed up for the follow-up course. That's an awesome result: more
            than half the students want to return.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Nobody signed up for the \textdollar{}3,000 ten-week class.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            A majority of the students commented that although they enjoyed the
            morning class and got a lot out of it, the evening session was much
            tougher to follow. They said that after a full day of work they were
            tired and all they wanted to do on the ride home was relax. (Bob also
            confessed that teaching the evening class was much harder, because he
            was also tired.)
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        This is a realistic example of the invaluable YODA that you can collect
        when you take an idea out of Thoughtland and pretotype it. This data
        speaks loud and clear: \textdollar{}300 one-week classes will be more popular---and
        much easier to schedule, plan, and sell---than the original idea of a
        \textdollar{}3,000 ten-week course. Furthermore, we've learned that although the
        morning lectures worked well, the evening ones were a challenge for the
        students and the teacher, because everyone was tired at the end of the
        day.

        Over the next six weeks we run two more pretotyping experiments with
        one-week courses, one with Google employees and one with LinkedIn
        employees. The results from these new experiments align with and confirm
        xyz3A. This means that our hypothesis can now be promoted to data and
        that we have our first set of YODA:

        {\bf YODA1:} Out of a sample of 600, 132 (22\textpercent{}) of
        Google and LinkedIn engineers commuting from San Francisco to Mountain
        View paid \textdollar{}300 for a one-week BusU course on artificial intelligence.

        This YODA comes with
        almost \textdollar{}40,000 of skin in the game (\textdollar{}300 times 132).

        Furthermore, in the process of pretotyping, we've also acquired
        additional valuable YODA, including the following:

        {\bf YODA2:} Zero out of 132 (0\textpercent{}) students who
        completed a one-week \textdollar{}300 BusU course on AI signed up for a \textdollar{}3,000
        ten-week course.

        {\bf YODA3:} 48\textpercent{} of students who completed a
        one-week \textdollar{}300 BusU course on AI signed up for another one-week course
        at the same price.

        {\bf YODA4:} About 12\textpercent{} of students who sign up will miss
        the first class and ask for a refund.

        {\bf YODA5:} 89\textpercent{} of the students prefer a
        morning-only class.

        Instead of wasting time writing a BusU business plan based on OPD,
        opinions, and all sorts of untested assumptions, we invested the time to
        collect data to demonstrate that there is indeed a business. {\em Before
        writing a business plan, make sure that there is a business.}

        \subsection{What's Next?}

        The YODA spoke loud and clear. A significant number of high-tech
        professionals are interested in BusU's one-week courses, but not in the
        longer (and much more expensive) classes. So, at least for now, we
        abandon the idea of offering ten-week classes for \textdollar{}3,000 (\fsp{i.e.}, Idea
        1). We decide instead to focus on one-week \textdollar{}300 classes (Idea 2), but
        with a tweak to the original plan: we will limit the formal lectures to
        the morning commute, and use the evening commute for more relaxed and
        informal office hours and Q&A with the instructor.

        We update the XYZ
        and xyz hypotheses and run a few more pretotyping experiments to
        validate this new model. In the process we collect even more YODA and
        learn additional valuable lessons (\fsp{e.g.}, we can earn an additional \textdollar{}60
        per student by selling coffee and snacks on the bus). Here's what the
        TRI Meter for the BusU business model for \textdollar{}300 classes (Idea 2) looks
        like after five experiments:

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image218.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        It looks as if the new version of BusU has a good chance of being The
        Right It, wouldn't you agree?

        \section{A Few Notes About the BusU Example}

        Before we close this chapter, I'd like to point out a few important
        things about this example.

        {\bf Note 1:} In the process of validating our idea, we've collected the
        kind of firsthand data (YODA) with skin in the game that
        will help us make a
        very strong business case if we decide to seek VC funding.

        \startitemize
          \startitem
            Instead of a Thoughtland-based business plan filled with hope, hype,
            and fantasy five-year financial projections, we can show actual costs,
            actual revenue, actual profit, and the kind of skin-in-the-game market
            feedback that is hard to ignore (\fsp{e.g.}, 48\textpercent{} of the
            students who took one class signed up for at least another class).
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            With several successfully completed courses, we have also demonstrated
            that we know how to run such a business (\fsp{i.e.}, that we can execute the
            idea competently---build It right).
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            By investing our own skin in the game (our time and money) to test the
            idea and by working through the numerous challenges and obstacles,
            we've shown commitment and resiliency.
          \stopitem
          \startitem
            Finally, by tweaking our original vision and business model to reflect
            the data we collected, we've demonstrated flexibility and agility in
            responding to the market---two must-have characteristics to succeed in
            today's rapidly changing markets.
          \stopitem
        \stopitemize

        A team bringing all of the above data and evidence to a potential
        investor will not only significantly increase their chances of getting
        funded, but also be in a strong position to ask for a higher valuation.

        {\bf Note 2:} This was a fictional scenario meant to illustrate our
        methods, but it's based on a true story. I did have the idea for BusU
        while stuck in commute traffic and for a period of time I seriously
        considered starting such a business. Furthermore, everything I've
        described is both plausible and doable: Google does offer free commuter
        buses to its employees, Google does
        reimburse some
        tuition expenses, charter buses can be rented for about \textdollar{}1,000 per day,
        and I am sure that I would be able to find some AI experts willing to
        teach the classes.

        {\bf Note 3:} This example points toward a happy ending---but not for
        the first version of our idea. If we had gone full speed ahead with the
        original plan based on \textdollar{}3,000 ten-week accredited classes, our BusU
        business would have crashed! The original BusU idea was The Wrong It; we
        found The Right It version of BusU through testing and tweaking.

        {\bf Note 4:} My goal for the BusU example was to show you one possible
        way the tools and tactics we've learned might be combined and a possible
        scenario of how things might work out. The specific sequence of events
        and results will vary from case to case. But, generally speaking, your
        goal is to go from rough idea, to testable hypotheses, to experiments,
        to data from those experiments, and then to use that data to make an
        informed decision on the next steps. Depending on the nature and quality
        of the data you get, those next steps can range anywhere from making
        minor tweaks to the idea or hypotheses (and running more tests), to
        scrapping the idea altogether, to---if you are lucky---determining that
        your idea is likely to be The Right It and going forward with it.
      \stopchapter

      \startchapter[title={Final Words},reference=chapter:9]
        I began this book with the following ominous warning:

        {\bf It waits. Patient.}

        {\bf Confident that it will soon get its prey---it always does.}

        {\bf Few escape its bite, none its tentacles.}

        {\bf One way or another, the Beast of Failure gets us all.}

        I wrote those somber words in one of my notebooks in the days right
        after my startup failed. They came out of my pen as I was trying to
        figure out how the hell this could have happened. As you can probably
        tell, I wasn't exactly in a cheery mood at the time. It was a dark and
        bitter period for me for two reasons, one obvious and one not so
        obvious.

        The obvious reason for my gloomy mood was that our company, after an
        incredibly promising start, almost \textdollar{}25 million of investment from three
        of the most successful VC firms in the world, and five years of really
        hard work by dozens of top-notch
        people, had to be
        shut down and sold off. As much as that hurt and embarrassed me and many
        of the people associated with the company, I knew we'd all recover and
        move on.

        The final meeting with the investors, the board of directors, and the
        lawyers was not exactly fun, but it was not as terrible as I---a novice
        at failure on this scale---thought it would be. No one yelled, no one
        got angry, no one pointed blaming fingers. Instead, the tone of the
        meeting was a combination of disappointment, understanding, and---to my
        surprise---a {\em lack} of surprise. The investors, the other board
        members, and the lawyers had been through the same scenario (brilliant
        idea + good plan + plenty of funding + strong and experienced team +
        competent execution = failure) many times already. For them it was par
        for the course. Most startups fail, even those that hold much promise
        and seem like a sure thing. Remember Webvan?

        I knew the stats about startup failure too, but somehow I didn't think
        that those dismal odds had any relevance to our company. They couldn't
        possibly apply to us. For starters, we had gone through exhaustive
        technical due diligence, done our market research, wrote a great
        business plan, and gotten funding from great investors. Then, after
        putting together an amazing team, we built the exact product we said we
        were going to build and our target market told us they wanted, needed,
        and would definitely buy. In other words, we had checked all the boxes.

        So WTF!? Why The Failure!? It made no sense to me.

        That was the root of the second, less obvious (but deeper and
        longer-lasting) reason for my gloom. What made it so pitch dark, so
        bitter, and so pervasive was that several of my deeply held beliefs
        about the way the world is supposed to work had been shattered. The
        formula for success that I witnessed,
        learned, believed
        in, and emulated had failed me. To my internal logic it was as if, all
        of a sudden, I could no longer count on 2 plus 2 adding up to 4.

        At first, I felt lost, hopeless, betrayed. Then, slowly but steadily,
        the shock and pain of my first big failure morphed into something
        healthier: a desire to understand how and why something like this could
        happen---not just to our company, but to anyone who tries to bring a new
        idea into the world. I wanted to use that understanding to prevent it
        from happening again. As I mentioned in the Prelude, the Beast of
        Failure had bitten me, and I decided to bite back, or at least learn how
        to armor and defend myself against the worst of its bite.

        I would figure out where and how we had gone wrong, discover ways to
        prevent those errors in the future, and share those findings with the
        world. That's what this book is all about.

        In this concluding chapter I review and summarize those findings, repeat
        and highlight some of the most important points, and close with some
        important final words of advice and encouragement.

        \section{The Right It: A Recap}

        \subsection{A Review of the Hard Facts}

        \in{Part}[part:1] began with the following
        imperative, the guiding principle of this book:

        {\bf Make sure you are building The Right It before you build It right.}

        To reach The Right It, you must come to terms with a number of hard
        facts, hard because they are hard to take, hard to
        avoid, and unlikely
        to change. The mother of all hard facts is the Law of Market Failure:

        {\bf Most new products will fail in the market, even if competently
        executed.}

        Most new products that make it to market fail because they are The Wrong
        It, defined as {\em an idea for a new product that, even if competently
        executed, will fail in the market.}

        Next hard fact:

        {\bf No amount of design brilliance, engineering prowess, or marketing
        fireworks can save a product that is The Wrong It from the jaws of the
        Beast of Failure.}

        This second fact explains why even the world's most successful companies
        (\fsp{e.g.}, Coca-Cola, Disney, Google) will often launch new products that
        fail in the market. These expertly executed new products fail because
        they are based on the wrong Premise---the market is not interested in
        them regardless of how well (or by whom) they are designed, built, or
        marketed.

        I then introduced the hero of our book: The Right It is {\em an idea for
        a new product that, if competently executed, will succeed in the
        market.} Which brought us to our third hard fact:

        {\bf Your only chance for success is to combine competent execution with
        a product that is The Right It.}

        But how can we know if a product is The Right It before we have actually
        built It? How can we tell if the market will want It if It does not even
        exist yet? The seemingly logical---but catastrophically wrong---answer
        to that question is: \quotation{We'll ask people if they want it or will buy it.}

        Unfortunately, this approach, conceived of and carried out in
        Thoughtland,
        produces opinions, not data. And people's opinions, including so-called
        expert opinions, are not reliable predictors of success, because our
        thought process and conclusions are invariably distorted by a covey of
        cognitive errors and biases. In Thoughtland, many ideas that are The
        Wrong It get an enthusiastic thumbs-up from the target market (a false
        positive), while many ideas that are The Right It get shot down as lame
        or ludicrous (a false negative).

        So when it comes to validating ideas for new products, we cannot depend
        on what people think, say, or promise. Instead, we must escape the
        treacherous trolls of Thoughtland by recognizing and acting upon our
        fourth hard fact:

        {\bf Data beats opinions.}

        But not just any old data, especially not Other People's Data (OPD). OPD
        is at best unreliable, because what happened to other people, with other
        products, at other times does not necessarily apply to our idea for a
        new product.

        So the next hard fact specifies what kind of data we need:

        {\bf You need to collect Your Own DAta (YODA).}

        If \quotation{data beats opinions} and YODA beats OPD, then does that mean that
        {\em YODA beats every other possible source or form of data} about the
        likelihood of success of your idea? Yes! Most emphatically YES! YODA
        beats them all---provided that YODA is collected, filtered, and analyzed
        rigorously and objectively.

        The final hard fact assures the quality of your data:

        {\bf To count as proper YODA, your market data must come with some skin
        in the game.}

        You cannot just ask the market if they are interested in and
        likely to buy your
        new product and take their word for it. You need something of value to
        back up their statements and promises, ideally money---the most
        universal and quantifiable form of skin in the game. But how do you
        solve the chicken-and-egg challenge of collecting YODA to determine if
        your idea is The Right It unless you have already built It? You use the
        tools in \in{Part}[part:2].

        \subsection{A Review of the Sharp Tools}

        Finally, after a barrage of hard facts, the first bit of good news: not
        only is YODA the most reliable and relevant indicator of potential
        market success, but collecting YODA is faster, cheaper, and more fun
        than collecting worthless opinions and stale OPD---provided you have the
        right tools.

        \subsubsection{Thinking Tools}

        The first step in our quest for reliable YODA is to rid our idea of the
        mental fuzz (vague descriptions, unspoken assumptions, \fsp{etc.}) acquired in
        Thoughtland and {\em articulate it as precisely and as clearly as
        possible}. This step is particularly valuable for teams, because it
        helps identify and reconcile conceptual differences among team members.

        Behind every idea for a new product is a Market Engagement Hypothesis
        (MEH). The MEH is a high-level description of how we assume (or hope)
        the market will engage with our product. In the case of Second-Day
        Sushi, for example, the MEH was:

        {\bf Many people will buy less-than-fresh sushi if we make it cheap
        enough.}

        The Market Engagement Hypothesis is a necessary starting point, but it's
        usually too vague to be usable. We need to {\em say it
        with numbers,}
        turning the fuzzy MEH into an unambiguous XYZ Hypothesis using the
        format: \quotation{At least X\textpercent{} of Y will Z.}

        {\bf At least 20\textpercent{} of packaged-sushi eaters will try
        Second-Day Sushi if it's half the price of regular packaged sushi.}

        Finally, we need to go from a broad XYZ Hypothesis to a set of smaller
        xyz hypotheses that we can test quickly and cheaply. Here's one example:

        {\bf At least 20\textpercent{} of students buying packaged sushi at
        Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it's half the
        price of regular packaged sushi.}

        In three quick steps, we went from a vague high-level idea to a clearly
        stated, ready-to-be-tested hypothesis. Now, armed with our xyz
        hypothesis, we are ready to test our new product idea on our target
        market. Even though we don't have the product to test our hypotheses
        with yet, pretotyping will enable us to forge ahead without it.

        \subsubsection{Pretotyping Tools}

        Pretotyping can play a key role in validating our idea. Pretotyping
        differs from traditional prototyping in that pr{\bf {\em o}}totypes are
        usually designed, built, and used to verify that an idea can be built,
        to explore the best ways to build it, and to test that it will work as
        expected, and pr{\bf {\em e}}totypes are built for a single---but
        singularly important---purpose: to validate our Market Engagement
        Hypothesis.

        Prototypes help us answer the key question: {\em Can} we build it?
        Pretotypes, in contrast, answer a very different question: {\em Should}
        we build it? With pretotyping, we can answer this question quickly and
        inexpensively. Whereas traditional prototypes
        can take weeks,
        months, or years to develop and cost millions, pretotyping experiments
        can produce data in a matter of hours or days and cost little.

        Some pretotyping techniques include the Mechanical Turk, the Pinocchio,
        the Fake Door, the Facade, the YouTube, the One-Night Stand, the
        Infiltrator, the Relabel, but these are just a small sample of the many
        great effective, efficient, and fun ways to pretotype an idea. For any
        new product idea there is---at least---one great way to pretotype it and
        to get some YODA in a matter of hours. I encourage you to modify, adapt,
        and combine these basic techniques to best fit your idea. Better yet,
        invent and experiment with your own technique and give it a name (\fsp{e.g.},
        Mike's Magic Carpet pretotype).

        \subsubsection{Analysis Tools}

        After running a few well-crafted pretotyping experiments you will
        finally possess the most valuable, relevant, and reliable type of data:
        fresh YODA straight from your target market. But having fresh YODA is
        not enough; you need to calibrate it and interpret it before you can use
        it to reach a conclusion on which to base a decision. A pair of analysis
        tools, the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper and the TRI (The Right It) Meter,
        will help you weigh, analyze, and interpret the YODA you collected with
        rigor and objectivity.

        The {\em Skin-in-the-Game Caliper} allows you to assign the proper value
        to the data you collect according to how much skin in the game
        accompanies it. A \textdollar{}250 preorder counts more than, say, a \textdollar{}50 deposit
        to be put on the waiting list, which counts more than a submitted email
        address. Opinions, of course, are worth zero points; as are thumbs-ups,
        likes, and comments.

        The {\em TRI Meter} is a graphic tool designed to help you take
        the result from each
        pretotyping experiment, put it against your XYZ and xyz hypotheses, and
        judge the degree to which the YODA supports the likelihood that your
        idea is The Right It. The TRI Meter uses a five-step scale that ranges
        from Very Unlikely to Very Likely, and, as a reminder that most new
        ideas will fail in the market, at the bottom, pointing to Very Unlikely,
        is the big black Law of Market Failure arrow. That arrow reminds us that
        we need more than just a couple of encouraging experiments to balance
        out those initial odds.

        Since most new ideas will fail, if you've been objective in designing
        the experiments and fair in evaluating the results, you should not be
        surprised if your first few TRI Meters yield Unlikely or Very Unlikely
        scores. But if you keep at it, unless you are really unlucky, you will
        eventually find yourself staring at a TRI Meter with Idea arrows
        pointing to Likely or Very Likely. There are no guarantees, of course,
        but---assuming that you've been careful, objective, and fair in applying
        the tools and judging the data---a positive TRI Meter should allow you
        to move on to the next stage in the development of your idea: building
        It right.

        \subsection{A Review of the Plastic Tactics}

        Some tactics to help you use our tools more efficiently and effectively
        include \quotation{Think globally, test locally,} \quotation{Testing now beats testing
        later,} and \quotation{Think cheap, cheaper, cheapest.} Those tactics suggest that
        you design your experiments to minimize Distance to Data, Hours to Data,
        and Dollars to Data. A final tactic, \quotation{Tweak it and flip it before you
        quit it,} teaches the importance of tweaking your idea before abandoning
        it if the YODA from your initial set of experiments is discouraging. The
        first version of your idea may be The Wrong It, but you may be just a
        few tweaks away from The Right It: test, tweak, repeat.

        A final
        comprehensive example, BusU, teaching classes on commuter buses, showed
        how the many tools and tactics can be applied, combined, and put into
        action. We went from idea, to hypotheses, to experiments, to decisions.
        The example was realistic and peppered with unexpected challenges and
        opportunities. These demonstrated that it's perfectly okay to tweak your
        original idea and change your plans along the way based on what you
        learn about the market as you run your experiments. In fact, it's more
        than okay---it's exactly what you should do.

        \subsection{There Are No Guarantees}

        Phew, we've covered a lot of ground, haven't we? It may seem like a lot
        to keep track of. If I could have made it shorter or simpler, I would
        have, as in the quote usually attributed to Albert Einstein, \quotation{Everything
        should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.} However, each of
        the steps fits into a logical sequence that should make it easier to
        remember and that, with a bit of practice, will become second nature and
        automatic.

                {\em Go for it!} You can't be 100\textpercent{} sure that your
                idea is The Right It, but the YODA looks promising enough for you to
                take a calculated risk.

              \startitem
                {\em Drop it.} As much as you'd like your idea to succeed, the YODA

                {\em Tweak it.} In the process of testing your idea, you have
                learned invaluable things about your target market and its
                willingness (or unwillingness) to engage with your product. Don't
                hesitate to tweak your original idea (or your hypotheses) to reflect
                what you've learned along the way. You may find that although there
                is not enough market interest in your original idea, there may be
                great interest in something related to it. Or try flipping the idea
                on its head and see what you come up with.
              \stopitem

        \startplacefigure
          \externalfigure[images/image230.jpg]
        \stopplacefigure

        Even if competently executed, these steps cannot guarantee that an idea
        will succeed in the market. It's impossible to predict or take steps to
        prevent all of the possible external factors that
        can turn even the
        most promising and well-tested idea into a market failure. But if you
        diligently follow and apply what I've shared with you in this book, I
        feel confident enough to make you three promises.

        {\bf {\em Promise 1: You will dramatically reduce your probability of
        failure.}} How dramatically? If you run enough well-designed pretotyping
        experiments, and their results provide strong and consistent validation
        for your hypotheses, then you have probably found an idea that is The
        Right It. Armed with The Right It, you should be able to flip the odds
        in your favor: from an 80ish percent chance of failure to an 80ish
        percent chance of success. Provided, of course, that you execute the
        idea competently (\fsp{i.e.}, you build It right). Unforeseeable and
        unpreventable external events and bad luck may still cause you to
        ultimately fail. But if that happens I can make the next promise to you.

        {\bf {\em Promise 2: Even if you fail, you will not feel like a fool.}}
        If you crash and burn in the market {\em because} you haven't adequately
        tested your idea, you should feel like a fool. Especially now, because
        after reading this book you should know better. But if you fail {\em
        despite} all your diligent and objective market testing, then you might
        feel disappointed and discouraged, but you should not feel foolish. If a
        poker player holding four aces (1 in more than 4,000 odds) bets big and
        loses to another player's royal flush (1 in more than 70,000 odds),
        that's not being foolish; that's being extremely unlucky.

        {\bf {\em Promise 3: If you stick with it, you will eventually
        succeed.}} Throughout the book, I've talked a lot about the Beast of
        Failure and the Law of Market Failure. Failure is the villain of this
        book and, like all good villains, it grabs our interest and demands
        attention. But we should not forget that although market success happens
        much less frequently, it is not {\em that} rare. It's not a
        one-in-a-million
        shot. It's not like winning the lottery. It's much, much better than
        that. If 80\textpercent{} to 90\textpercent{} of new products fail
        in the market, that means that some 10\textpercent{} to
        20\textpercent{} succeed. Those are odds that we can work with.

        That means that, with some luck, if you apply what you've learned in
        this book, you may have to go through and test five or ten ideas (or
        variations on the original idea), but you will eventually hit on an idea
        that is The Right It---provided, of course, that each successive idea
        (or idea variation) integrates and takes into account what you've
        learned from your previous market experiments. Even if a pretotyping
        experiment fails to validate your hypotheses, you will discover
        something new about the market: new facts, new opportunities you did not
        know about, new resources. And if you are smart, you will use that new
        information and those newly discovered resources to guide your next
        steps---which will help you find The Right It sooner.

        It's a bit like card counting in blackjack: if you keep track of the
        cards that have already been dealt and bet accordingly (bet less when
        the remaining deck is unfavorable, more when it's favorable), you can
        turn the odds of winning in your favor. That's why most casinos ban card
        counters. The real world is, of course, infinitely more complicated and
        far less predictable than a casino game. In the market, the risks,
        rewards, and odds of success for any given idea change all the time
        (that's why it's so important to have fresh firsthand data---YODA). But
        the fact remains that the more data you collect by experimenting in a
        given market, the better you will understand some of its behaviors, and
        the more likely you are to converge on an idea that is The Right It.

        All right, we are almost done. But there is one final exceedingly
        important topic that we need to cover.

        \section{What to Build?}

        As I hope you will learn firsthand by applying them, the tools and
        tactics I've shared with you are powerful stuff. They have the power, if
        properly used, to help you avoid The Wrong It, find The Right It, and
        thus flip the odds for success in your favor. And that's no small thing.
        In fact, it's a {\em huge} advantage!

        But, as they say, with power comes responsibility. How will you use that
        power? Or more precisely, what kind of new idea would you create and
        bring to market if you were reasonably confident (say 80ish percent)
        that it would succeed?

        That's a big question. An existential question. One that deserves a lot
        of thought, because even if you are sure that you have The Right It, it
        will still take a lot of time, investment, effort, sacrifice, and
        commitment to build It right and to keep It going. A full and proper
        answer to this question is beyond the scope of this book and probably
        deserves a book of its own. But I will briefly address two key aspects
        of this question:

        Is this idea The Right It for you?

        Is this idea The Right It for the world?

        \subsection{Make Sure It's The Right It for You}

        The best ideas---the ones to which the market responds with the greatest
        interest and enthusiasm---are often the ones that require the most
        effort and commitment. Before you know it, you may find yourself with
        thousands of eager customers knocking on your (fake) door. It's
        exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. And unless you are fully
        committed to your idea and prepared for all the work ahead, that kind of
        success can create more pain and headaches than a failure.

        Early in my career,
        one of my managers had an expression for that kind of situation; he
        called it a {\em success disaster}. He was fond of saying, \quotation{If you think
        failure is hard, you haven't experienced real success.} I didn't fully
        understand what he meant until I found myself in a success-disaster
        scenario myself. He was right! Failure is a beast, but success can be a
        beast too. The experience of finding and latching on to an idea that is
        The Right It can often be compared to having the proverbial tiger by the
        tail. Just ask Tesla's Elon Musk.

        As I am writing this, Musk is experiencing just such a success disaster.
        In 2016 Tesla announced the long-awaited Tesla Model 3---the company's
        most affordable car, about half the price of the previous models.
        Following the proven Tesla playbook, the company required people to put
        down a \textdollar{}1,000 deposit (skin in the game) to get in line for the car.
        Preorders poured in by the hundreds of thousands (talk about YODA!). The
        first year of production for the Model 3 sold out in a matter of days,
        and the orders kept pouring in. Eventually Tesla found itself with
        approximately 500,000 preorders---half a billion dollars of skin in the
        game, an unprecedented and unqualified success by most
        automotive-industry standards. Now all that Tesla had to do was to build
        and deliver a few hundred thousand Model 3s. That's a lot of cars for a
        fledgling and relatively small auto company.

        Fast-forward a year or so and, not too surprisingly, a series of
        production issues resulted in significant delays and uncertainty in
        delivery dates. Many of the people who had put their \textdollar{}1,000 deposits in
        Tesla's bank account were getting upset and wanted to know if and when
        they would get their cars. Elon Musk responded (via Twitter) as follows
        to one of those people:

        You'll know as soon as we do.

        We are deep in production hell.

        On another occasion,
        Musk tweeted the following about the situation: \quotation{The reality is great
        highs, terrible lows, and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to
        hear about the last two.}

        But people did want to hear more about the \quotation{last two}---and how Musk
        handles terrible lows and unrelenting stress. He replied as follows
        (emphasis mine): \quotation{I'm sure there are better answers than what I do,
        which is just take the pain and {\em make sure that you really care
        about what you're doing}.}

        Thank you, Elon, for providing us with the inspiration, and even the
        wording, for the key message of this section---an important
        qualification to our main message:

        \startmiddlealignment
          {\bf Make sure you are building The Right It}

          {\bf {\em and make sure that you really care about It}}

          {\bf before you build It right.}
        \stopmiddlealignment

        As we've learned, finding The Right It is not easy; it takes a lot of
        work, creativity, and persistence. Unless you are very lucky, it will
        take several rounds of testing, failing, and going back to the drawing
        board before you land on an idea that survives our market validation
        process. So when you finally discover that winning idea for a new
        product, be prepared to do it justice---and be prepared for the hard
        work ahead. Finding The Right It is the end of one quest and the
        beginning of another, longer and harder quest: building It right, and
        then marketing It right, selling It right, servicing It right, and so
        on, all the while fighting the competitors that inevitably pop up when a
        new idea that is The Right It is discovered.

        It's unlikely that you'll ever find yourself in a success-disaster
        situation of the same magnitude as Elon Musk's, but I guarantee you that
        you will have to deal with a wide range of problems, complications, and
        mini-disasters of your own. And unless you
        really care about
        that idea of yours, you will not have the motivation necessary to handle
        those obstacles and see it to fruition. In other words, in order to
        ultimately succeed with an idea, it's not enough to know that the idea
        is The Right It for the market; it has to be The Right It for you. It
        has to be a two-way match.

        How can you know ahead of time if an idea is right for you? Once again,
        I can give you no guarantees. But leaving Thoughtland and going through
        the pretotyping process will teach you not only about the market's
        actual response to the idea, but also about {\em your} response to
        working with the idea. And that's another great reason to do
        pretotyping. Let me explain.

        Being clear about your hypotheses, putting them to the test, and
        analyzing the results objectively is the most effective and efficient
        way to validate your idea against the market. It requires commitment and
        quite a bit of work, but it should also be fun, exciting, and engaging.
        If you are not experiencing at least some fun and excitement working
        with your idea at this early stage (\fsp{e.g.}, devising, creating, and
        running pretotyping experiments), either you are doing it wrong or the
        idea and market you are testing are probably not a good match for you.
        And that's something that you should not overlook, because it's a strong
        indicator that the idea you are working on may not be The Right It for
        you.

        If you are not enjoying the pretotyping process, at some point you have
        to ask yourself some tough questions:

        Even if this idea that I hatched in Thoughtland turns out to be The
        Right It, is it likely to be {\em my thing}?

        Am I cut out for this kind of job, this kind of product (or service or
        business)?

        Do I really want to be in this market for the next few years?

        If you cannot answer
        these questions affirmatively, you should reconsider pursuing the
        idea---even if that means abandoning an idea that is likely to succeed
        in the market. You don't want to be stuck working on something you don't
        care about. Sooner or later (and probably sooner rather than later) you
        will get fed up with it and stop giving it your best---you'll stop
        building It right. And that's not fair to your idea, your investors,
        your customers, or yourself.

        Many people, including myself, dream of starting a restaurant. My wife
        and I talk about it all the time. In Thoughtland owning a restaurant
        sounds great: you get to have fun designing the dining room, creating
        the menu, hobnobbing with the customers, and making lots of money along
        the way. The reality, as every restaurateur knows, is very
        different---more grungy than glamorous. Even if your restaurant concept
        is The Right It, you will be spending more time on marketing, personnel
        issues, supplier problems, accounting, and so forth, than coming up with
        the perfect steak tartare (yum!).

        As you pretotype your idea, you will learn not only if the idea is The
        Right It, but if you are the Right Person (or Team) to execute the idea.
        And that's just as important. Let me share with you a typical example.

        Two years ago, I received an email from a young entrepreneur; let's call
        him Darrell. Darrell had an idea for an innovative and eco-friendly
        diaper-delivery and -disposal service. He had read my preto-book {\em
        Pretotype It} and thought that two of the pretotyping techniques I
        described were perfectly suited for testing his idea. To make sure he
        was on the right track, he contacted me to explain his concept and to
        get some feedback on his plans for pretotyping it. I suggested a couple
        of minor tweaks to make his tests more objective, wished him good luck,
        and asked him to
        keep me posted. And since my children are now in their twenties, that's
        the last I thought about diapers for a while.

        A few months later, Google asked me to teach a seminar on pretotyping to
        the diapers division of a major consumer-goods company. While preparing
        for the event, I was reminded of Darrell's diaper-delivery idea. I was
        curious to know how his pretotyping experiments turned out, so I
        contacted him to get an update. The next day I received an email from
        him:

        Sorry I didn't keep you posted as promised, Alberto.

        I ran the experiments we discussed and got good results---enough to
        convince me that the idea had a really good chance to be The Right It.

        But in the process of doing that I realized that I don't really want to
        be in the diaper business. It's not my thing. I am now pretty sure I can
        make my idea for the business successful---perhaps even very
        successful---but I had no fun working on it. To be honest, I hated it!
        It was a good idea, and someone else should do it, but it won't be me. I
        learned that I don't give a darn about diapers. I don't even have
        children. I would just do it for the money, and that's not good enough.
        My real passion and interest is soccer. So I will try to come up with a
        soccer-related idea and use your techniques on that.

        I am sorry for wasting your time and sorry to disappoint you.

        Darrell didn't waste my time (or his), nor did he disappoint me. Far
        from it. He didn't find the diaper business sufficiently, ahem,
        absorbing. Good for him! He discovered that this industry is not his
        thing---and that's {\em a great thing}. Better that he discovered
        that now rather than
        later, when he would be knee-deep in it.

        When you use pretotyping to test an idea against the market, the idea
        and the market are also testing {\em you}---sort of. So while you are
        collecting market data about your idea's market {\em desirability}, also
        keep an eye on its {\em enjoyability}. Would you enjoy working with this
        product, in this market, for the long term? Running a business based on
        your idea may sound great in Thoughtland, but as Darrell and many
        aspiring restaurateurs have discovered, the reality is often very
        different.

        Make sure that your idea is not just a good match for the market, but
        also a good match for you.

        \subsection{Make Sure It's The Right It for the World}

        I saved this section for last not because I consider it an afterthought,
        a postscript, something relatively unimportant. On the contrary, I saved
        it for last because I consider it to be extremely important. These are
        the words with which I want to leave you.

        Everything I've shared with you up to now has been factual, practical,
        logical: tools, techniques, tactics; metrics, markets, money; testing,
        trying, tweaking. Time to shift gears and raise the level of our
        discourse. Time to get a little philosophical---for your own long-term
        benefit and that of the world. Don't worry, I am not going to go all
        preachy on you. I just want to make sure that now that you have the
        tools and know-how to help you succeed, you will feel confident to go
        after bigger, better, more worthwhile ideas. Not every idea is equally
        worthy of our efforts---even if, technically, it is The Right It.

        \subsubsection{Stay Away from Breaking-Bad Ideas}

        If we define The Right It based purely on market demand (\fsp{i.e.}, lots of
        people wanting, needing, buying your product) and
        market success
        (\fsp{i.e.}, a highly profitable multimillion-dollar industry), then crack
        cocaine, meth, cigarettes, and a number of other recently developed
        addictive products and substances, both legal and illegal, would
        qualify.

        Where should you draw the line to determine if an idea is the {\em
        wrong} Right It, a product that will succeed in the market but will do
        more harm than good to everyone involved in it? I can't tell you that. I
        obviously have my own set of totally subjective and biased criteria:
        crack cocaine, bad; microbrewed beer, good (and single-malt scotch even
        better). Let a combination of your conscience, local laws, and customs
        be your guide. Asking yourself, \quotation{What would my grandma think of this?}
        should also steer you right most of the time. (I say {\em should}
        because I don't know your grandma.)

        With the tools and knowledge that you now have at your disposal, you
        possess the means to explore and test a wide range of ideas, so there is
        no reason to get involved in the kind of dangerous, shady, or illegal
        products and businesses that can get you and others in trouble.
        Hopefully, your idea for a new business does not involve cooking up a
        superior variety of meth in the middle of the desert. Don't go {\em
        Breaking Bad} on me. On the other hand, if your new idea involves tasty
        microbrewed beer or single-malt scotch, feel free to send me samples.

        \subsubsection{Think Beyond Quick-Buck Ideas}

        Some ideas for new products may not violate any laws or customs; they
        are neither immoral nor unethical. But they are also not the best use of
        your knowledge, time, and effort. Such ideas may not make the world a
        worse place, but they won't make it a better place either---they won't
        make much of a difference one way or another. They are the kind of
        gimmicky products that are bought on
        impulse, used once
        or twice, and then tossed away or forgotten.

        Soon after the original iPhone was launched, for example, the market was
        inundated with all kinds of really silly 99\textcent{} apps: fart machines,
        simulated paper staplers, virtual cigarette lighters, \quotation{games} in which
        you compete against others to see how many times you can tap on a
        virtual button, and so on. (Full disclosure: I admit to buying one such
        app in 2008---but you'll have to guess which one.) There's nothing
        inherently wrong with pursuing quick-buck ideas---especially at the
        beginning of your career (say, to pay off your student loans) or when
        you have an urgent need for cash (say, to buy a Tesla~.~.~. just
        joking~.~.~. well, sort of). But if you have the programming skills to
        develop a mobile phone app, do you really want to use them to turn a
        smartphone (which is an amazing tour de force of technology) into a
        virtual whoopee cushion?

        \subsubsection{Think Beyond Business}

        Most of the examples in the book are based on business ideas, but all
        the concepts and tools you learned about can---and should---be applied
        to other areas. Nonprofit organizations such as charities, hospitals,
        schools, and even governments are subject to the Law of Market Failure
        just as much as commercial ventures. Social entrepreneurs measure their
        success using metrics other than money (\fsp{e.g.}, percentage of people with
        access to clean water, reduction in the number of deaths by malaria,
        number of freed political prisoners), but they still have to deal with
        the very high probability that their new idea or approach will not work
        as well as they think or hope. In fact, when it comes to many of the
        world's worst problems (including famines, preventable diseases, and all
        sorts of violence), we are still desperately looking for solutions that
        are The Right It. The Beast of Failure will not give
        you a pass just
        because you are working for a good cause, but our tools and tactics will
        help you {\em fight the good fight} and win.

        \subsection{Go for the {\em Right} Right It}

        What would you build if you knew that it would succeed? What kind of
        product, service, book, or company would you create?

        The world is full of serious problems waiting for solutions and
        meaningful opportunities looking for champions. My hope is that what
        you've learned in this book will give you not just the know-how, but the
        confidence and courage to aim high and to build and bring into the world
        something of lasting value, something that will make the world better,
        something worthy---and worthy of you.

        Finding an idea that is The Right It, building It right, achieving
        market success, and reaping the financial rewards that can come from it
        feels great. But accomplishing the same with an idea that is
        particularly meaningful to you and beneficial to the world feels {\em
        amazing}.

        Furthermore, you will discover that if an idea is meaningful to you and
        beneficial to the world, your odds for success will increase
        dramatically for two reasons. First, if you really care about the
        problem you are solving and the market you are serving, you will be much
        less likely to abandon the idea when you run into your first (second,
        third, or umpteenth) obstacle. You will find the motivation and energy
        to keep going and overcome whatever challenges come your way.

        Second, if your product is beneficial and valuable to the world, you
        will not only experience much less resistance to it, but also find all
        sorts of unexpected people and organizations popping up to help you and
        cheer for you along the way because they want to see you and your idea
        succeed.

        So don't settle on
        just any idea. Look for an idea that is the {\em right} Right It---an
        idea that, if competently executed, will not only be successful in the
        market, but will also be meaningful to you and beneficial to the world.
        Then do It justice and build It right.

        I am rooting for you!

        {\bf The beast is still there.}

        {\bf Still waiting. Still hungry.}

        {\bf Unchanged and unchangeable.}

        {\bf Ready to fight~.~.~.}

        {\bf and so am I.}

  \starttitle[title={Acknowledgments}]
    First and foremost, I want to acknowledge and thank Stanford University
    professor Tina Seelig. Tina has not only been an amazing supporter and
    champion of my work for many years, but she, more than anyone else, has
    encouraged, pushed, and prodded me to stop making excuses and to \quotation{just
    sit down and write the darn book.} The fact that Tina managed to publish
    two books of her own---and begin work on a third one---while I kept
    procrastinating provided me with the motivation and embarrassment I
    needed to get going. Tina, it's safe to say that without you this book
    would still only exist in my own private Thoughtland. Thank you so much;
    {\em you} are a gem.

    Next, I want to thank HarperOne's Gideon Weil for reviewing my original
    book proposal and for convincing me that I had something unique and
    worthwhile to share. Gideon and the entire HarperOne team (Laina Adler,
    Judith Curr, Kim Dayman, Mary Duke, Adrian Morgan, Ann Moru, Courtney
    Nobile, Sydney Rogers, Lisa Zuniga, and the designer, Terry McGrath)
    have been fantastic to work with. I feel privileged to have Levine
    Greenberg
    Rostan as my literary agency---thank you, Jim Levine, for taking me
    under your very wise and experienced wing.

    A most heartfelt thank-you to our dear friend Natalie \quotation{once an English
    teacher, always an English teacher} Panfili for her invaluable editing,
    feedback, and suggestions as I wrote the first draft. Knowing that I
    could count on Natalie to review my work-in-progress gave me the
    motivation and confidence I needed to keep going---even when the end
    seemed impossibly distant. If writing a book were a marathon (and at
    times it felt like it), Natalie would be the friend running alongside me
    to make sure I made it to the finish line. Natalie, {\em we} did!

    The second group I want to acknowledge and thank are the many people
    who, in one way or another, helped me develop, refine, and share the
    material covered in this book.

    The original set of concepts and tools for The Right It and pretotyping
    were first developed and tested at Google with the participation of
    hundreds of Google team members. Unfortunately, I cannot acknowledge
    them all, but a few individuals and teams deserve special mention. Eric
    Schmidt and Wayne Rosing, who not only hired me and mentored me as a
    young engineer at Sun Microsystems, but also gave me the honor and
    opportunity of a lifetime by hiring me again as Google's first
    engineering director. Urs Hölzle, for his wise guidance and support.
    Patrick Copeland, who got stuck managing me when I began to experiment
    with \quotation{that pretotyping thing} and who has been a great evangelist and
    supporter ever since. The original Unleash the Innovators team of
    pretotypers: Bob Evans, C.P. Lim, Stephen Uhler, and Deanna Chen.
    Cecelia Wogan-Silva, the first to bring me and my work outside Google
    and beyond Silicon Valley. Google's Chief Innovation Evangelist and
    Stanford d.school adjunct professor Frederik G. Pferdt. A final---and
    very
    special---thank-you
    goes to Google's amazing Executive Summits team, for giving me the
    opportunity to share The Right It and pretotyping with many of the
    world's largest and most influential companies---thank you, Brandi
    Andrews Mihailovski, Alaina Beeman, Christina Carroll, Alan Eagle, Mike
    Emling, Matthew Hubbard, Kristie Lane, Michele Maiorino Kelly, Jessica
    Michaelis, Theresa O'Connell, Ivonne Tamariz, Kristin Villanueva, and
    Jessica Webb.

    Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Baba Shiv gets the
    credit, and has my deepest appreciation, for being the first to invite
    me to give a lecture on pretotyping at Stanford. {\em Grazie,} Baba!
    Since that first lecture in 2011, I've had the pleasure and honor to
    teach, coach, and share pretotyping with hundreds of Stanford students
    and visiting executives through lectures, courses, and workshops. In
    addition to Baba Shiv and Tina Seelig, I would like to acknowledge and
    thank the following members of Stanford's faculty and staff for all the
    amazing teaching opportunities and support they've given me over the
    years: Tania Abedian, Tom Byers, Leticia Britos Cavagnaro, Chuck Eesley,
    Mark Grundberg, Matt Harvey, Rachel Julkowski, Riitta Katila, Harjoth
    Khara, Tom Kosnik, Michael Peña, Navdeep Sahni, Anaïs Saint-Jude, Nikkie
    Salgado, Eli Shell, Ryan Shiba, and Danielle Steussy.

    The proverb \quotation{As you teach, you learn} proved to be true again and again.
    I cannot think of a single pretotyping project, workshop, class, or talk
    where I did not learn something new or find a way to improve on existing
    material. So, a huge thank-you to all my students.

    In 2011, I invested one week to write and edit (sort of) the short
    booklet {\em Pretotype It}, a pretotype version of this book, which I
    then released as a free PDF. I have no idea how many thousands
    of people have
    read {\em Pretotype It}, because over the years it has been shared on
    countless websites and translated by volunteers into a dozen languages.
    But the many emails I received from readers all over the world who loved
    the booklet and urged me to \quotation{write a proper book} with more tools and
    examples gave me the data and motivation I needed to write this book.
    Thank you all.

    Some of my former students, colleagues, and readers took their interest
    in my work a step further and became master practitioners, evangelists,
    and teachers of pretotyping tools and techniques. Thanks to them, these
    ideas are now being taught, refined, and practiced in many countries and
    organizations I could have never reached myself. A few of these
    invaluable partners in pretotyping deserve a special mention. In the US:
    Jeremy Clark, Patrick Copeland, Rich Cox, Eric Alessandrini, Michael
    Thomas. In Europe: Leonardo Zangrando, Tim Vang, Dan Cobley, Elalami
    Lafkih. In Australia and Asia: Leslie Barry.

    I've benefited from the help, knowledge, and experience of many, many
    people over the past few years, and I have a terrible feeling that some
    of them who fully deserve to be acknowledged here are not. If that's the
    case, please know that it's not due to a lack of gratitude, but to a
    mortifying fiasco by my memory, on whose behalf I sincerely apologize.

    Finally, a loving thank-you to my family and friends. I would not have
    been able to write {\em The Right It} without the encouragement and
    support of the Right Wife, the Right Daughter, the Right Son, the Right
    Parents, and the Right Friends.

  \starttitle[title={Glossary}]
    \startconcept{Beast of Failure:}
      An imaginary merciless and insatiable creature
      that devours most new product ideas and bites and slashes those who
      pursue those ideas without first validating them.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{Data beats opinions:}
      A key rule you need to internalize and
      practice with no exceptions if you want to improve your odds for market
      success. Don't base your product decisions on opinions. Base them on
      market data, and not just any old data or other people's data (see
      OPD)---but your own (see YODA).
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{DTD (Distance to Data):}
      A metric to help you quantify and minimize
      how far you have to go to collect your market data.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{\textdollar{}TD (Dollars to Data):}
      A metric to help you quantify and minimize
      how much it will cost to collect your market data.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{expert opinions:}
      {\em See} opinions.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{Failure is not an option:}
      An inspiring but wrong and often harmful
      phrase and belief suitable for Hollywood movies but ill suited for most
      business ventures. Use it only if you are writing dialogue for an action
      flick with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{false negative:}
      An idea that is mocked and knocked in Thoughtland but, when competently
      executed and brought to market, turns out to be a success.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{false positive:}
      An idea that sounds great in Thoughtland, is
      competently executed and brought to market, and fails miserably. Most
      market failures are false positives.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{HTD (Hours to Data):}
      A metric to help you quantify and minimize
      how long it will take to collect your market data.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{hypozooming:}
      The process of taking an XYZ Hypothesis and \quotation{zooming}
      it in with regard to scope, space, and time to derive a set of smaller
      related xyz hypotheses that can be tested locally, quickly, and
      inexpensively. For example, the xyz hypothesis for Second-Day Sushi: \quotation{At
      least 20\textpercent{} of students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café
      today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it's half the price of
      regular packaged sushi.} The principle is that if the XYZ Hypothesis is
      true, then the easily testable hypozoomed xyz hypotheses derived from it
      will reflect that.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{If there's a market, there's a way:}
      An important reminder that if
      there's enough market interest in an idea for a product, you (or someone
      else) will usually be able to find a way around whatever engineering,
      financial, legal, or other obstacles currently stand between the idea
      and its realization. If an idea is The Right It, one way or another it
      will usually find its way to market.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{If there's no market, there's no way:}
      If there is no market
      interest in an idea, no amount of brilliant design, amazing engineering,
      superior reliability, or marketing fireworks will help the idea succeed.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{If we build it, they will come:}
      An overly optimistic, ill-founded sentiment not
      suitable for business ventures, because they {\em won't} come, unless
      you are building The Right It. However, by transposing two words and
      adding a question mark, you get the critical question you should ask
      before building anything: \quotation{If we build it, will they come?} That's the
      key question this book helps you answer.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{Law of Market Failure:}
      \quotation{Most new products will fail in the market,
      even if competently executed}; the stubborn hard fact that most new
      product ideas are destined to fail and that competent execution of an
      idea cannot save it from failure.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{market failure:}
      When the actual market result from an investment
      in a new product is less than or the opposite of the expected result.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{market success:}
      When the actual market result from an investment
      in a new product meets or exceeds the expected result.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{MEH (Market Engagement Hypothesis):}
      A high-level description that
      combines the fundamental premise behind a new product idea with a vision
      of how the target market will engage with it. For example, the MEH for
      Second-Day Sushi: \quotation{A lot of people who want to eat healthy and who like
      sushi can't afford to eat it regularly, because sushi tends to be quite
      expensive. If we can find a way to make sushi as affordable as other
      fast food, a lot of fast-food patrons will choose sushi over less
      healthy alternatives.}
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{OPD (Other People's Data):}
      Market data collected by other people
      at other times, in other places, with other methods, using other
      filters, and for other purposes. Technically, OPD is data, but
      since it's not {\em
      your} data, it can be as dangerous and as misleading as opinions. OPD is
      no substitute for YODA ({\em see} YODA), and given that OPD is neither
      necessary nor sufficient for evaluating your ideas, it's best to not
      waste time seeking it.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{opinions:}
      Subjective, biased, and often baseless judgments about
      an idea's prospects for success. In the quest for The Right It, opinions
      are worse than useless---they are downright dangerous and misleading.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{pretotype:}
      A specific artifact or technique used in pretotyping.
      Some pretotypes are the Mechanical Turk, the Pinocchio, the Fake Door,
      the Facade, the YouTube, the One-Night Stand, the Infiltrator, and the
      Relabel.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{pretotyping:}
      Using a group of tools and techniques to collect
      fresh, reliable, and relevant market data ({\em see} YODA) about an idea
      for a new product as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. The goal
      of pretotyping is to help you {\em make sure that you are building The
      Right It before you build It right.}
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{Say it with numbers:}
      A reminder to quantify whenever possible. A
      number, even if it's just an educated guess at the time, is more
      informative and useful than some fuzzy, vague term. For example, instead
      of \quotation{Our widget will be inexpensive,} say, \quotation{Our widget will cost \textdollar{}10,}
      or \quotation{Our widget will cost 40\textpercent{} less than the
      competition's.}

    \startconcept{skin in the game:}
      Something {\em of value} given to you by the
      market as evidence of interest in your idea. The simplest form of skin
      in the game is money (\fsp{e.g.}, a paid preorder or a deposit), but it could
      also be someone's time, information, reputation, and so on.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{Skin-in-the-Game Caliper:}
      A tool to help you quantify and calibrate skin in the game,
      necessary because not all skin in the game is created equal. For
      example, a \textdollar{}1,000 preorder for a product should count more than a \textdollar{}100
      deposit for the same product, and a commitment to attend a one-hour
      presentation should count more than, say, an email address.

    \startconcept{Thoughtland:}
      An imaginary place where ideas for new products hang
      around collecting solicited and unsolicited opinions. Like visits to Las
      Vegas, visits to Thoughtland are best kept short: most of what happens
      in Thoughtland should stay in Thoughtland.

    \startconcept{The Right It:}
      An idea for a new product (or service, company,
      initiative, \fsp{etc.}) that, {\em if} competently executed, will succeed in
      the market. The Right It is like Kryptonite to the Beast of Failure.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{The Wrong It:}
      An idea for a new product (or service, company,
      initiative, \fsp{etc.}) that, {\em even if} competently executed, will fail in
      the market. The Wrong It is like catnip to the Beast of Failure.
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{TRI Meter (The Right It Meter):}
      A tool for mapping and visualizing
      the results of pretotyping experiments to help determine how likely it
      is that an idea is The Right It.

    \startconcept{XYZ Hypothesis:}
      What you get when you apply \quotation{say it with numbers}
      to the Market Engagement Hypothesis. The basic form for the XYZ
      Hypothesis is: \quotation{At least X\textpercent{} of Y will Z,} where
      X\textpercent{} represents a percentage of your target market, Y, and
      Z represents how that percentage of the market will engage with your new
      product idea. For example, the XYZ Hypothesis for Second-Day Sushi: \quotation{At
      least 20\textpercent{} of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day
      Sushi if it's half the price of regular packaged sushi.}
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{xyz hypothesis:}
      A small, specific,
      easily and quickly testable hypothesis that is derived from, and
      consistent with, a broader XYZ Hypothesis. For example, a possible xyz
      hypothesis for Second-Day Sushi is: \quotation{At least 20\textpercent{} of
      students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café today at lunch will choose
      Second-Day Sushi if it's half the price of regular packaged sushi.} The
      process of going from a broad XYZ Hypothesis to one or more xyz
      hypotheses is called {\em hypozooming.}
    \stopconcept

    \startconcept{YODA (Your Own DAta):}
      Data about {\em your own} product idea,
      collected firsthand by {\em you and your own team}, by running
      experiments {\em you} designed to validate {\em your own} market
      hypotheses. To qualify as such, YODA must come with skin in the game
      ({\em see} skin in the game). Unlike OPD, YODA is both necessary and
      sufficient for evaluating your idea.
